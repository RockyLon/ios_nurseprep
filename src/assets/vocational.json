        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Traditional adult learners are individuals who come to the educational program directly from high school or another program of study. They are usually in their late teens or early 20s. The learner who has been out of school for many years would be identified as a returning adult learner. The learner who has children and grandchildren might be a returning adult learner or a recycled learner. The learner who knows the routine of education does not provide sufficient information for classification."

        "Explanation": "The recycled adult learner has been out of school for several years and returns as a result of a life transition, such as loss of a job. This learner shares some of the characteristics of both traditional and returning adult learners. However, this adult learner might have technical school or college experience or an undergraduate or graduate degree in a discipline other than nursing. Discipline-change learner is not a recognized learner classification. The traditional adult learner comes to the nursing program directly from high school or another program of study.

        "Choice 4": "ridicule.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Some degree of fear of failure is nearly universal and often relates to earlier failures or setbacks the learner has experienced in other educational settings. Few individuals are afraid of succeeding. Uncertainty about economic issues is common among students but is not as universal as fear of failure. Fear of ridicule is rarely a concern; if present, it is usually superseded by fear of failure."

Absorbing the knowledge taught by the instructor describes passive learning. Studying only what the instructor emphasizes in class and focusing on learning 65% of the information that is taught are approaches that severely limit learning."

        "Explanation": "Tests should be considered learning experiences. Learners should look at tests with the goal of understanding why incorrect answers are wrong, as well as the rationale for correct answers. Looking at the test grade and handing the test and answer sheet back is not optimal learning behavior. Arguing each wrong answer with the instructor does not promote the openness required for optimal learning. Appearing interested in the test results does not promote learning."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Identifying positive behaviors allows them to be reinforced, and identifying areas needing improvement fosters modification of the negative behaviors. Providing constructive criticism related to poor performance behaviors refers to only half of the purpose. Keeping unsuitable persons from achieving licensure is not the purpose, because early identification and change in negative behaviors foster ultimate success in the program. Helping learners develop the ability to listen to negative comments about performance is not a purpose of the clinical performance evaluation."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Awareness of one’s actions is a component of self-evaluation. Noticing a breach of sterile technique during performance of a clinical skill is an excellent example of self-evaluation. “The other student forgot to use a bath blanket” describes evaluation of one student by another. “The staff nurse was abrupt with the resident” describes evaluation of a staff nurse by another person. “It was nice to be complimented by my instructor” is a reflection of feelings associated with being complimented, not self-evaluation."

        "Choice 4": "The instructor will provide academic counseling.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Providing academic counseling or making referrals for academic counseling is a responsibility of faculty members. The other options are not reasonable expectations. Only the individual with the problem can resolve it, albeit with assistance from another. Motivation is an internal factor for the student. It is the learner’s responsibility to seek out the instructor for examination review."

        "Choice 4": "with manual dexterity and confidence.”",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Students are required to provide care at the same level of safe practice as the LPN/LVN. A lesser standard is not acceptable. This makes the importance of skill practice in the school’s practice laboratory understandable. Errors may affect patient safety. Provision of patient care at the same level as classmates is true only if the level of classmates is consistent with LPN/LVN safe practice. Provision of patient care with manual dexterity and confidence does not provide for safe practice."

        "Explanation": "This response reflects the student’s responsibility for seeking faculty help when having difficulty in class or clinicals. Asking the smartest student in class might not be helpful if this student is also having difficulty understanding the content. Asking the patient for his or her view would not provide balanced information. An Internet search might not yield relevant information."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 2, 3",
        "Explanation": "Discovering positive actions of students indicates that it is important to identify positive actions and reinforce them via clinical performance. Making students aware of ineffective clinical behaviors indicates that ineffective clinical behaviors stand in the way of attaining the goal of providing safe, effective patient care. If this goal is not met, the long-term goal of program completion is jeopardized. Role-modeling how to conduct evaluations of others indicates that role-modeling is a desired outcome of clinical performance evaluations. Providing students the opportunity to tell the instructor how the instructor’s attitude discourages learning is not a desired outcome of clinical performance evaluation."

Part of creating an optimal learning environment includes having approachable faculty who are available to help students who encounter questions or problems the student cannot independently resolve using available resources. Solving each of the student’s learning problems is unrealistic and would rob the student of active participation. Making learning simple and free from psychological pain is not realistic. Learning is rooted in the learner. The instructor cannot guarantee student response. Eliminating difficult concepts from lectures and laboratories is not realistic. Many important nursing concepts are complex and may seem difficult. They cannot be eliminated from a curriculum if the learner’s education is to meet standards."

        "Explanation": "Peer monitoring and reporting are essential to patient safety and professional integrity. Accountability means being held accountable for all nursing actions performed.

        "Answer": "1, 3",
        "Explanation": "Autonomy means being free to choose. The statement, “I wish I knew for sure that I had all the facts about the treatment,” suggests that the patient may not have had all the relevant facts. The statement, “My son told me emphatically what he thought would be best for the family,” suggests undue influence from the family.

        "Explanation": "The state board of nursing of the state in which the LPN/LVN wishes to work can provide the essential information. Eighteen states have mutual recognition compacts, and Minnesota has a border recognition agreement. National licensure does not exist. A nurse working legally in any state that borders state X without applying for endorsement describes a border recognition agreement, such as the one in existence in Minnesota. It is unnecessary for a nurse to apply to take the NCLEX-PN examination; nurses can obtain endorsement without retaking the NCLEX-PN examination."

        "Explanation": "Assigning an SP/VN to a complex nursing situation shows poor judgment. A complex nursing situation involves a patient whose clinical condition is unpredictable. Nursing care expectations are beyond what the LPN/LVN has learned during the educational program. An instructor is expected to make patient assignments based on student knowledge and ability to give safe nursing care and is expected to provide necessary supervision."

        "Question": "The instructor tells a student nurse, “You have functioned at a substandard level of clinical performance recently. Now you have a chance to redeem yourself. I’m assigning you to a complex nursing situation. I expect you to function without asking for assistance.” The most appropriate response from the student nurse would be",
        "Choice 1": "“I’ll try my best, but I will need someone on staff to answer my questions.”",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The student nurse is obligated to refuse an assignment that is clearly beyond the scope of his or her abilities rather than jeopardize patient safety. Placing a student in a complex nursing situation without access to supervision is totally inappropriate."

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The patient’s request must be honored, but agency protocol must be followed in doing so.

        "Explanation": "The nurse should deal directly with the physician who wrote the order. If this is unsuccessful, the nurse should use the nursing chain of command. Carrying out the orders as written without questioning is unsafe and may cause harm to the patient. Going directly to the patient and asking the individual to make a decision abut the order is unrealistic and inappropriate.

Feeling sorry for the patient’s situation suggests sympathy rather than empathy. Understanding the patient’s thoughts but being unaware of his or her feelings and emotions speaks of a nurse who lacks awareness of others’ emotions.

The statements, “This is nature’s way. You can be glad it happened” and “How lucky to have lost the baby so early in your pregnancy” are insensitive and do not suggest active listening.

        "Explanation": "Chiding is scolding. The intent of the communication is not to give advice but to chastise the patient for noncompliance. Probing is pushing for additional information. The question at the end of the scolding is rhetorical and does not ask for actual information."

The patient verbalizing that he is in pain and describing it is an example of verbal behaviors. Body language, such as lying still with the eyes closed, the arms held rigidly at the side of the body, and the fists clenched better describes nonverbal communication than affective state. A patient listening to directions and then asking relevant questions describes verbal communication."

African American patients convey respect by making and maintaining eye contact. Loud voices are the norm among African Americans talking with family or friends. Native Americans consider making eye contact a sign of disrespect. Touch is common among Mexican American members of the same sex, and personal space is close."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Elderly people lose the ability to hear high-frequency sounds but are often able to hear lower frequency sounds. Using a low voice register will be more helpful than pitching the voice in the higher registers. Children from birth to age 2 are soothed by low-pitched voices. Preschool children have immature reasoning skills. Use of slang with teenagers is ill-advised, because meanings change with great speed."

        "Explanation": "Summarizing means briefly stating the main data gathered. For example: Nurse: “This is what I heard you say. Is that correct?” Silence involves pauses used with skill. Validation provides the patient with an opportunity to correct information, if necessary, at the time of summary.

Reflection is putting into words information received from the patient at an affective communication level.

        "Explanation": "Violence prevention includes both respect for patients and self-confidence in nurses. Nurses who are passive and tentative are more likely to be victims of violence. Patients who feel they are not respected are more likely to use violence as a way of getting their needs met. Requiring nurses to work in groups rather than alone would not be possible. Having security personnel stationed on all units would not entirely eliminate violence; many patients would not be aware of the presence of security officers on the unit, whereas others impaired by medication or illness would not factor in the presence of security personnel. Assigning only male nurses to care for psychiatric or chemically dependent patients is neither practical nor desirable."

Performance of specific nursing tasks for a number of patients, such as taking vital signs, doing simple dressings, and so on, describes the team method of care delivery.

The LPN/LVN may be a first-line manager, supervising care given by LPN/LVNs and unlicensed assistive personnel while being directly responsible to the RN nurse manager.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Buddhists believe pain and suffering are due to actions in this or a past life. The correct option accepts the patient’s belief. The statement, “Are you saying you have been a bad person?” is probing. Encouraging a patient who practices Buddhism to ask God to help them bear the pain is inappropriate, because Buddhists do not believe in God. Enlightenment has a specific meaning to Buddhists; it refers to finding the truth of existence and should not be used as a general term."

Telling the patient that he can count on seeing his pastor within a day or two is false reassurance. It is true that due to federal law, the hospital cannot make the patient’s name available to clergy, but that statement does nothing to help the patient make contact with the minister.

There is not a clear need to provide information about Medicaid. It’s too late to secure group health insurance for this identified health care need.

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Fee-for-service is the traditional method of paying health care bills in which physicians are paid a fee by the patient for each service they provide. Inflation is a general rise in prices, usually persisting over several years. Capitation is an alternative to the traditional fee-for-service method of payment. Capitation involves a set monthly fees charged by the provider of health care services for each member of the insurance group for a specific set of services. Gross domestic product is the combination of all goods and services produced in a nation’s economy."

        "Explanation": "The U.S. health care system responds to illness rather than health promotion. Universal access is not available. National health insurance is not available. The system is fragmented, with a variety of payment options and multiple sources of funding and only a few seamless systems in place. The U.S. health care system has been described as a poorly designed, fragmented, and disjointed maze of services that lacks preventive care, wastes resources, and is low quality, unsafe, and confusing."

Striving to complete the entire goal at one time often leads to procrastination because the task seems too large.

        "Explanation": "Becoming proficient in medication administration and developing skill in efficient, effective collection of patient data are examples of long-term goals. They are umbrella goals that have several component parts that must be accomplished to fulfill the overall goal. Attaining a grade of B and successful initial completion of admission forms are simpler in nature and have only one component."

        "Explanation": "Each of these behaviors focuses on something related to the program of study and thus is a constructive use of learner time. Smoking reduces the flow of oxygen to the brain. Eating a candy bar results in rebound hypoglycemia. Both smoking and eating a candy bar reduce the efficiency of learning and thus are poor uses of time."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 2, 3, 4",
        "Explanation": "Determining which activities take priority each morning operationalizes the principle of planning. Asking family members to run errands or prepare meals makes use of delegating. Reviewing reasons for going to school with a spouse helps gain support from and collaboration with a significant other. Reserving 3 hours daily for reading, organizing notes, and studying is an example of daily planning. Substituting recreational activity for study time describes failure to implement daily and weekly plans. Delaying complex tasks until a large block of time is available is an example of procrastination. Minitasking would be a better solution."

        "Explanation": "The nursing assistant should not perform tasks for which he or she has not been trained. The nurse should arrange to teach the nursing assistant so that he or she can safely perform the duty. Reprimanding the nursing assistant for not performing the job is unnecessary. Encouraging the nursing assistant to carry through with the transfer is unwise and unsafe.

        "Explanation": "Providing positive reinforcement for the specific behaviors used makes it more likely that the NA will use these strategies in the future. The LPN/LVN’s communication is straightforward and assertive. Writing a note for the NA’s file explaining that she did not leave the resident in his room would not be effective as a motivator. Telling the NA she is a great nursing assistant and the charge nurse wished all assistants were like her is not specific enough. Reporting the NA’s good efforts to the nursing home administrator and board of directors is not necessary at this point."

        "Explanation": "Evaluation should be a joint interactive process rather than a one-way communication. Dialogue can clarify and enhance the process. Evaluation should focus on identification of strengths as well as behaviors to be modified. The statement “You’re doing fine” does not exemplify measurable feedback. The tone should be nonthreatening and objective but does not require the evaluation to begin with positive feedback. An employee may develop his or her own plan, but the individual needs to include problem areas identified by the charge nurse as well as the employee’s own goals."

Today, the RN charge nurse presents the LPN/LVN charge nurse with a certificate recognizing her ability to manage effectively despite short staffing. The LPN/LVN responds somewhat politely but seems more angry than pleased. In terms of the Howlett hierarchy of needs, which of the following is the best explanation for the employee’s reaction?",
        "Choice 1": "The LPN/LVN is probably responding to the poor working conditions.",

On entering the shower stall, I found Mrs. Garrity crying and shivering. She was sitting naked on the shower chair and was alone in the room. She stated that Becky, her nursing assistant, told her she had to leave for a phone call. I covered Mrs. Garrity with a bath blanket that was on the shelf in the bathroom. At that point Becky returned and confirmed that she had received a phone call.

The goal for an obese resident who has had a recent knee replacement that states she will ambulate using a walker with the assistance of a staff member is level 2, essential to safety.

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "This individual would know both the academic record and clinical performance strengths of the student nurse. Because the instructor has given positive feedback, this person should be able to provide a positive reference. The program director may not have first-hand knowledge of clinical performance and might be less able to emphasize clinical performance strengths. The nurse who is the student nurse’s acquaintance at the health club would be unable to provide first-hand information about academic and clinical performance.

        "Explanation": "The student should make sure the individual is willing to be a reference and, moreover, is willing to write a positive letter. Looking in the catalog to make sure the name is spelled correctly is relevant but not the first step. Passing a course does not confer the right to use the instructor as a reference.

Limiting job applications to positions listed in the Help Wanted section of the newspaper makes use of only limited resources. Obtaining lists of job offerings posted in health care agencies suggests obtaining lists, but does not suggest taking further action.

It prevents the employer from making a snap decision about the individual without seeing the applicant and exploring his or her qualifications in greater detail. Answering all questions asked by the employers pleasantly, accurately, and completely allows the employer to substitute a phone call for a personal interview. Mentioning that you are in a hurry now but giving permission to receive a call back in an hour would be perceived as impolite.

        "Explanation": "The ability to communicate with hearing-impaired patients who use sign language would be an asset. It is better not to include salary expectations. Leisure time activities are not relevant. A résumé indicating plans to move to a nearby state after 1 year may prejudice the employer against hiring, because it costs money to orient new employees."

        "Explanation": "Conservative, business-appropriate clothing should be the first choice. Clothing should fit well so that it is comfortable to wear. Wearing conservative, tailored clothing will help the employer see an interviewee as one who will dress appropriately at work. One should try not to wear an outfit for the first time at the interview; having worn it before will give confidence that it fits well.

Many employers will not interview applicants unless all questions on the application have been answered. Writing in “Will explain” is preferable to leaving a blank. Never falsify an application. Be honest with the number of jobs held in the past year and give reasons for leaving. It is unwise to answer questions about wage requirements by inflating current salary by 20%.

Systematic review over a number of weeks prior to the NCLEX-PN examination will refresh one’s knowledge. Cramming is usually counterproductive, because it results in fatigue and lowers the ability to think clearly during the examination.

Drinking alcohol will interfere with critical thinking. Preparing yourself for the worst by picturing yourself having to reply is negative thinking and raises anxiety.

The board will send an application, instructions, fee schedules, and other materials. Asking the state board to send a copy of your NCLEX-PN examination score and photocopying your license and current registration are neither necessary nor priorities.

        "Explanation": "Each question that appears on the screen must be answered in order for the examination to continue. The basis for this is that question selection is based on the correctness of the answer given for the previous question. The computer determines that the candidate has passed when he or she has completed at least 85 questions and it can be determined that the person has correctly answered 50% of the questions with a high index of difficulty. All questions are scored. Not all testers answer the maximum number of questions (205). Seventy-five percent is not used to determine passing."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 5",
        "Explanation": "Most program examinations allow the tester to skip a question and return to it at a later time. The NCLEX-PN examination, as a computerized adaptive examination, individualizes testing, whereas program examinations are identical for all students taking a specific test. There is no penalty for guessing on the NCLEX-PN. Alternate formats can be used in program examinations and the NCLEX-PN examination. One should read all possible answers for both program examinations and the NCLEX examination. Early selection may lead to missing an answer that is better."

        "Choice 1": "A newly hospitalized patient who has disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome",
        "Choice 2": "A patient receiving physical therapy after a total knee replacement in a nursing home rehabilitation unit",

The patient described in the correct option is the only one who meets these criteria. A newly hospitalized patient with disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome is unstable and has unpredictable outcomes. The mother of a newborn with spina bifida and a ventricular peritoneal shunt for hydrocephalus requires extensive teaching and anticipatory guidance best given by an RN, whereas the infant requires close assessment of neurological status.

        "Explanation": "Such a position offers lower pay than the LPN/LVN scale, yet the individual is held to the requirements established by the highest license held. The LPN/LVN would not have difficulty receiving compensation from the agency; the payment problem is that nonprivate payers do not reimburse for care given by LPN/LVNs.

        "Explanation": "Many states, including New York, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, have removed barriers to LPN/LVN educational mobility. Articulation agreements and challenge examinations take care of courses being given academic credit in colleges. While in the military, one can take courses leading to a higher credential.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The process of myelination of neurons accounts for neural pathways becoming more efficient when a learning exercise, such as reviewing notes, is repeated several times. Studying at the same time each day and reviewing notes several times do not directly relate to the efficiency of neural pathways. Engaging in physical activity while studying has more to do with avoiding the fight-or-flight response that interferes with learning."

        "Explanation": "Concentration can be disrupted by internal distractions. In this case, taking a short break and making a list of the things to do so they are not forgotten could be enough to allow the student to concentrate. Turning on the radio to “drown out” distraction would not be helpful. Stopping studying is not appropriate, because there may never be fewer distractions. Doing what has to be done immediately and then returning to studying could take too much time away from studying."

        "Explanation": "The scenario describes a student who is negatively affected by environmental distractions. Sitting at a desk in a quiet room is the best environment for one who is easily distracted by environmental events, because it limits environmental stimuli. Sitting on a bed with the feet up and the back against a pillow would promote relaxation (sleep) and daydreaming.

        "Explanation": "For better understanding, a reader should read as he or she speaks (i.e., in phrases). You should read as you speak, which is not in a monotone. Slowing the pace of reading as the subject matter becomes more difficult will help with comprehension, and highlighting and writing notes in the margin not only forces a learner to process what he or she is reading, but also allows the reader to go back and review key points."

        "Explanation": "Reading for understanding takes time. It is possible that in addition to reading too rapidly, the individual is omitting the preview step of the PQRST method for reading textbooks and would profit from its use. The student is also likely to profit from the steps of questioning, stating, and testing. The PQRST method requires the reader to take the time necessary to lay down neural traces, thus enhancing recall. Reading each sentence word for word is unnecessary and not effective. Never moving the lips while reading is irrelevant. Understanding and recalling may be improved by making margin notes and underlining."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Making a list of questions about material that is not understood is an action that shows active student participation. Lecture-discussion sessions expect students to be self-directed in learning. Avoiding actively disagreeing with the instructor or other students and listening until called upon to answer questions are more passive than active behaviors. Using review books to check the depth of the material is beyond the scope of what’s expected from a student and would not be productive."

The course objectives state the overall outcomes of the course and are not particularly useful as study aids. The bibliography simply lists the resources used by the instructor in course preparation.

The library might have books at the appropriate level but would not provide individualized teaching. The Internet would be more likely to provide information about books available as resources rather than the actual remediation needed.

        "Explanation": "The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) is a periodical index containing current listings for nursing and allied health fields. It is produced in five bimonthly issues each year. The issues are later bound by year. The index in Education Index would not present technical data on nursing topics. Materia Medicus is more pertinent to medicine. Reader’s Guide to Periodical Literature focuses on articles from nontechnical magazines and would not contain references to nursing journal articles."

        "Explanation": "A computer simulation would require the student to actively use the nursing process to gather data, set priorities, plan, determine the best ways to implement, and evaluate care outcomes in carefully chosen representative clinical situations. Students are often more passive during observational experiences than while working through a computer simulation. Shadowing a venipuncturist, too, is a more passive situation for the learner and is limited to only one aspect of medication administration. Error avoidance is only one aspect of medication administration."

It is an ethical responsibility of each nurse to provide safe, effective care; thus, it is an ethical responsibility of the nurse to remain current. State boards of nursing may require a minimal number of continuing education units, but the nurse could select additional learning opportunities. Employing agencies may also require attendance at in-service programs. This will not absolutely guarantee the currency of the nurse.

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Co-dependent individuals feel the fate of nursing care rests on their shoulders, feel responsible for solving the problems of others (in this case, the charge nurse’s problems), engage in one-upmanship and intershift rivalries. These behaviors are evident in the scenario. Chronic complainer is incorrect because the scenario is more than an example of chronic complaining. The verbalizations do not suggest that the LPN/LVN is a team player. The verbalizations do not suggest chemical dependency."

Relaxation exercises elevate stress for about 3% of the population. “Relaxation requires knowledge of special techniques, but recreation takes no special skills” is an untrue statement."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 2, 3, 4",
        "Explanation": "Patient safety is a concern, because errors are more common when nurse-to-patient ratios are high. Patients in hospitals are sicker than previously. High patient acuity requires increasingly skilled nurses, and the high-acuity patient requires more nursing time; neither may be available during a nursing shortage. Errors increase when one nurse has a patient load that is so large that care is rushed. Nurses leave the workforce as a result of high stress; this worsens the shortage. High recruitment incentives are not considered major concerns associated with the shortage of nurses."

Diminishing job stress and burnout and adverse effects on patients’ safety are not reasons the nursing process and critical thinking are included in the LPN/LVN curriculum.
