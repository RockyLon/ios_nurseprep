        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIn Maslow's hierarchy of needs, pain relief addresses the patient's basic physiologic need. Activity, such as ambulation, is a higher level need above the physiologic need. Allowing the patient to see family addresses a higher level need related to love and belonging. Teaching the patient is also a higher level need related to the desire to know and understand and is not appropriate at this time, as the basic physiologic need of pain control must be addressed before the patient can address these higher level needs."

        "Choice 2": "Rapid change that is nearly permanent",
        "Choice 3": "Limitations on the settings where care can be provided",
        "Choice 4": "Increased need for social acceptance",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe sophisticated communication systems that connect most parts of the world, with the capability of rapid storage, retrieval, and dissemination of information, have stimulated brisk change as well as swift obsolescence in health care delivery strategies. The other answers are incorrect because, although we have rapid change in the delivery of nursing care, it does not last a long time; it is evolving as health care itself evolves. Giving nursing care has not become easier, it becomes more complex with every change; and it does not need to be more socially acceptable; it needs to be more culturally sensitive."

        "Choice 2": "Kegel exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor",
        "Choice 3": "Administration of hypotonic IV fluid",
        "Choice 4": "Limited fluid intake to prevent incontinence",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nReflex incontinence is associated with a spinal cord lesion that interrupts cerebral control, resulting in no sensory awareness of the need to void. Total incontinence occurs in patients with a psychological impairment when they cannot control excreta. A patient who is paralyzed cannot perform Kegel exercises. Intravenous fluids would make no difference in reflex incontinence. Limited fluid intake would make no impact on a patient's inability to sense the need to void."

        "Choice 1": "Keep a record of when the incontinence occurs.",
        "Choice 2": "Perform clean intermittent self-catheterization.",
        "Choice 3": "Perform Kegel exercises four to six times per day.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nFor cognitively intact women who experience stress incontinence, the nurse should instruct the patient to perform Kegel exercises four to six times per day to strengthen the pubococcygeus muscle. Keeping a record of when the incontinence occurs or accepting incontinence as part of aging are incorrect answers because they are of no value in treating stress incontinence. Women with stress incontinence do not need clean intermittent catheterization. Protective undergarments hide the effects of urinary incontinence but they do not resolve the problem."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nA turning schedule with a signing sheet will help ensure that the patient gets turned and, thus, help prevent pressure ulcers. Turning should occur every 1 to 2 hours, not every 8 hours, for patients who are in bed for prolonged periods. The nurse should apply lotion to keep the skin moist, but should avoid vigorous massage, which could damage capillaries.

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe leading cause of death for patients over the age of 65 years is cardiovascular disease. With age, heart muscle and arteries lose their elasticity, resulting in a reduced stroke volume. As a person ages, systolic blood pressure does not decrease, resting heart rate does not decrease, and the aged are not less likely to adopt a healthy lifestyle."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nConstipation is a common problem in older adults and increasing fluid intake is an appropriate early intervention. This should likely be attempted prior to recommending senna or other laxatives.

The patient's family is very upset because, before having surgery, the patient had no cognitive deficits. The patient is subsequently diagnosed with postoperative delirium. What should the nurse explain to the patient's family?",
        "Choice 1": "This problem is self-limiting and there is nothing to worry about.",

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nSurgery is a common cause of delirium in older adults. Delirium differs from other types of dementia in that delirium begins with confusion and progresses to disorientation. It has symptoms that are reversible with treatment, and, with treatment, is short term in nature.

The nurse has made the point that most people aged 75 years remains functionally independent. The nurse should attribute this trend to what factor?",
        "Choice 1": "Early detection of disease and increased advocacy by older adults",
        "Choice 2": "Application of health-promotion and disease-prevention activities",
        "Choice 3": "Changes in the medical treatment of hypertension and hyperlipidemia",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nEven among people 75 years of age and over, most remain functionally independent, and the proportion of older Americans with limitations in activities is declining. These declines in limitations reflect recent trends in health-promotion and disease-prevention activities, such as improved nutrition, decreased smoking, increased exercise, and early detection and treatment of risk factors such as hypertension and elevated serum cholesterol levels.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nBecause vascular dementia is associated with hypertension and cardiovascular disease, risk factors (e.g., hypercholesterolemia, history of smoking, diabetes) are similar. Prevention and management are also similar. Therefore, measures to decrease blood pressure and lower cholesterol levels may prevent future infarcts. Activity limitation is unnecessary and infarcts are not prevented by nutrition or the use of mobility aids."

Furthermore, their ability to respond to definitive treatment is impaired. The altered responses of older adults reinforce the need for nurses to monitor all body system functions closely, being alert to signs of impending systemic complication.

        "Choice 2": "Indicators that are useful and reliable in younger populations cannot be relied on as indications of potential life-threatening problems in older adults.",
        "Choice 3": "The same physiological processes that indicate serious health care problems in a younger population indicate mild disease states in the elderly.",

Option A is incorrect because a potentially life-threatening problem in an older person is more serious than it would be in a middle-aged person because the older adult does not have the physical resources of the middle-aged person. Physical indicators of serious health care problems in a young or middle-aged population do not indicate disease states that are considered “mild” in the elderly population.

The patient is complaining of pain, and you are preparing to administer the patient's first scheduled dose of hydromorphone (Dilaudid). Prior to administering the drug, you would prioritize which of the following assessments?",
        "Choice 1": "The patient's electrolyte levels",
        "Choice 2": "The patient's blood pressure",

        "Choice 4": "The patient's hydration status",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nBefore administering medications such as narcotics for the first time, the nurse should assess for any previous allergic reactions. Electrolyte values, blood pressure, and hydration status are not what you need to assess prior to giving a first dose of narcotics."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nA patient who receives opioids by any route must be assessed frequently for changes in respiratory status. Sedation is an expected effect of a narcotic analgesic, though severely decreased LOC is problematic. Fluid overload and paradoxical increase in pain are unlikely, though opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs in rare instances."

The pain-medication orders are written as a combination of an opioid analgesic and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) given together. What is the primary rationale for administering pain medication in this manner?",
        "Choice 1": "To prevent respiratory depression from the opioid",
        "Choice 2": "To eliminate the need for additional medication during the night",
        "Choice 3": "To achieve better pain control than with one medication alone",
        "Choice 4": "To eliminate the potentially adverse effects of the opioid",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nA multimodal regimen combines drugs with different underlying mechanisms, which allows lower doses of each of the drugs in the treatment plan, reducing the potential for each to produce adverse effects. This method also reduces, but does not eliminate, adverse effects of the opioid. This regimen is not motivated by the need to prevent respiratory depression or to eliminate nighttime dosing."

        "Choice 1": "“Over time you become more tolerant of the drug.”",
        "Choice 2": "“You may have become immune to the effects of the drug.”",
        "Choice 3": "“You may be developing a mild addiction to the drug.”",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nOver time, the patient is likely to become more tolerant of the dosage. Little evidence indicates that patients with cancer become addicted to the opioid medications. Patients do not become immune to the effects of the drug, and the body does not absorb less of the drug because of the cancer."

        "Question": "A 52-year-old female patient is receiving care on the oncology unit for breast cancer that has metastasized to her lungs and liver. When addressing the patient's pain in her plan of nursing care, the nurse should consider what characteristic of cancer pain?",
        "Choice 1": "Cancer pain is often related to the stress of the patient knowing she has cancer and requires relatively low doses of pain medications along with a high dose of anti-anxiety medications.",
        "Choice 2": "Cancer pain is always chronic and challenging to treat, so distraction is often the best intervention.",
        "Choice 3": "Cancer pain can be acute or chronic and it typically requires comparatively high doses of pain medications.",
        "Choice 4": "Cancer pain is often misreported by patients because of confusion related to their disease process.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPain associated with cancer may be acute or chronic. Pain resulting from cancer is so ubiquitous that when cancer patients are asked about possible outcomes, pain is reported to be the most feared outcome. Higher doses of pain medication are usually needed with cancer patients, especially with metastasis. Cancer pain is not treated with anti-anxiety medications. Cancer pain can be chronic and difficult to treat so distraction may help, but higher doses of pain medications are usually the best intervention. No research indicates cancer patients misreport pain because of confusion related to their disease process."

Part of the report had been passed on from the preoperative assessment where it was noted that he has been agitated in the past following opioid administration. What principle should guide the nurse's management of the patient's pain?",
        "Choice 1": "The elderly may require lower doses of medication and are easily confused with new medications.",
        "Choice 2": "The elderly may have altered absorption and metabolism, which prohibits the use of opioids.",
        "Choice 3": "The elderly may be confused following surgery, which is an age-related phenomenon unrelated to the medication.",
        "Choice 4": "The elderly may require a higher initial dose of pain medication followed by a tapered dose.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe elderly often require lower doses of medication and are easily confused with new medications. The elderly have slowed metabolism and excretion, and, therefore, the elderly should receive a lower dose of pain medication given over a longer period time, which may help to limit the potential for confusion. Unfortunately, the elderly are often given the same dose as younger adults, and the resulting confusion is attributed to other factors like environment. Opioids are not absolutely contraindicated and confusion following surgery is never normal. Medication should begin at a low dose and slowly increase until the pain is managed."

        "Question": "You are the nurse in a pain clinic caring for an 88-year-old man who is suffering from long-term, intractable pain. At this point, the pain team feels that first-line pharmacological and nonpharmacological methods of pain relief have been ineffective. What recommendation should guide this patient's subsequent care?",
        "Choice 1": "The patient may want to investigate new alternative pain management options that are outside the United States.",
        "Choice 2": "The patient may benefit from referral to a neurologist or neurosurgeon to discuss pain-management options.",
        "Choice 3": "The patient may want to increase his exercise and activities significantly to create distractions.",
        "Choice 4": "The patient may want to relocate to long-term care in order to have his ADL needs met.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIn some situations, especially with long-term severe intractable pain, usual pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic methods of pain relief are ineffective. In those situations, neurologic and neurosurgical approaches to pain management may be considered. Investigating new alternative pain-management options that are outside the United States is unrealistic and may even be dangerous advice. Increasing his exercise and activities to create distractions is unrealistic when a patient is in intractable pain and this recommendation conveys the attitude that the pain is not real. Moving into a nursing home so others may care for him is an intervention that does not address the issue of pain."

You are delivering a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump to the patient at your visit today. The family members will be taking care of the patient. What would your priority nursing interventions be for this visit?",
        "Choice 1": "Teach the family the theory of pain management and the use of alternative therapies.",
        "Choice 2": "Provide psychosocial family support during this emotional experience.",
        "Choice 3": "Provide patient and family teaching regarding the operation of the pump, monitoring the IV site, and knowing the side effects of the medication.",
        "Choice 4": "Provide family teaching regarding use of morphine, recognizing morphine overdose, and offering spiritual guidance.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIf PCA is to be used in the patient's home, the patient and family are taught about the operation of the pump as well as the side effects of the medication and strategies to manage them. The family would also need to monitor the IV site and notify the nurse of any changes, such as infiltration, that could endanger the patient. Teaching the family the theory of pain management or the use of alternative therapies and the nurse providing emotional support are important, but the family must be able to operate the pump as well as know the side effects of the medication and strategies to manage them. Offering spiritual guidance would not be a priority at this point and morphine is not the only medication administered by PCA."

She states that her daughter's morphine dose that she needs to control her pain is getting “higher and higher.” As a result, the mother is afraid that her daughter will overdose. The nurse educates the mother about what aspect of her pain management?",
        "Choice 1": "The dose range is higher with cancer patients, and the medical team will be very careful to prevent addiction.",
        "Choice 2": "Frequently, female patients and younger patients need higher doses of opioids to be comfortable.",
        "Choice 3": "The increased risk of overdose is an inevitable risk of maintaining adequate pain control during cancer treatment.",
        "Choice 4": "There is no absolute maximum opioid dose and her daughter is becoming more tolerant to the drug.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPatients requiring opioids for chronic pain, especially cancer patients, need increasing doses to relieve pain. The requirement for higher drug doses results in a greater drug tolerance, which is a physical dependency as opposed to addiction, which is a psychological dependency. The dose range is usually higher with cancer patients. Although tolerance to the drug will increase, addiction is not dose related, but is a separate psychological dependency issue. No research indicates that women and/or younger people need higher doses of morphine to be comfortable. Overdose is not an “inevitable” risk."

You review her PRN medications and see that she has an NSAID (ibuprofen) ordered every 6 hours. If you wanted to implement preventive pain measures when the patient arrives to your unit, what would you do?",
        "Choice 1": "Use a pain scale to assess the patient's pain, and let the patient know ibuprofen is available every 6 hours if she needs it.",
        "Choice 2": "Do a complete assessment, and give pain medication based on the patient's report of pain.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nOne way preventive pain measures can be implemented is by using PRN medications on a more regular or scheduled basis to allow for more uniform pain control. Smaller drug doses of medication are needed with the preventive pain method when PRN medications are given around the clock. Offering the medication is more beneficial than letting the patient know ibuprofen is available."

The patient asks “why does it still feel like my leg is attached, and why does it still hurt?” The nurse explains neuropathic pain in terms that are accessible to the patient. The nurse should describe what pathophysiologic process?",
        "Choice 1": "The proliferation of nociceptors during times of stress",

Hyperexcitable nerve endings in the periphery can become damaged, leading to abnormal reorganization of the nervous system called neuroplasticity, an underlying mechanism of some neuropathic pain states. Neuropathic pain is not a result of age-related changes, nociceptor proliferation, or dependence on medications."

You are developing this patient's plan of care. On what should the goals for the plan of care focus?",
        "Choice 1": "Increase the patient's pain tolerance in order to achieve psychosocial benefits.",

Thus, the best set of goals would be to “decrease time lost from work to increase the quality of interpersonal relationships, and decrease anxiety.” Increasing pain tolerance is an unrealistic and inappropriate goal; exercise could help, but would not be the focus of the plan of care. Decreasing the need to work does not address his pain. Evaluating other work options to decrease the risk of depression is a misdirected diagnosis."

Hydrostatic pressure refers to changes in water or volume related to water pressure. Diffusion is the movement of solutes from an area of greater concentration to lesser concentration; the solutes in an intact vascular system are unable to move so diffusion normally should not be taking place. Active transport is the movement of molecules against the concentration gradient and requires adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as an energy source; this process typically takes place at the cellular level and is not involved in vascular volume changes."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe kidneys regulate the bicarbonate level in the ECF; they can regenerate bicarbonate ions as well as reabsorb them from the renal tubular cells. In respiratory acidosis and most cases of metabolic acidosis, the kidneys excrete hydrogen ions and conserve bicarbonate ions to help restore balance. The lungs regulate and reabsorb carbonic acid to change and maintain pH. The kidneys do not buffer acids through electrolyte changes; buffering occurs in reaction to changes in pH. Carbonic acid works as the chemical medium to exchange O2 and CO2 in the lungs to maintain a stable pH whereas the kidneys use bicarbonate as the chemical medium to maintain a stable pH by moving and eliminating H+."

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nProbably the most common cause of metabolic alkalosis is vomiting or gastric suction with loss of hydrogen and chloride ions. The disorder also occurs in pyloric stenosis in which only gastric fluid is lost. Vomiting, gastric suction, and pyloric stenosis all remove potassium and can cause hypokalemia. This patient would not be at risk for hypercalcemia; hyperparathyroidism and cancer account for almost all cases of hypercalcemia. The nasogastric tube is removing stomach acid and will likely raise pH. Respiratory acidosis is unlikely since no change was reported in the patient's respiratory status."

        "Choice 1": "Leave one hand ungloved to assess the site.",
        "Choice 2": "Cleanse the skin with normal saline.",
        "Choice 3": "Ask the patient about allergies to latex or iodine.",
        "Choice 4": "Remove excessive hair from the selected site.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nBefore preparing the skin, the nurse should ask the patient if he or she is allergic to latex or iodine, which are products commonly used in preparing for IV therapy. A local reaction could result in irritation to the IV site, or, in the extreme, it could result in anaphylaxis, which can be life threatening. Both hands should always be gloved when preparing for IV insertion, and latex-free gloves must be used or the patient must report not having latex allergies. The skin is not usually cleansed with normal saline prior to insertion. Removing excessive hair at the selected site is always secondary to allergy inquiry."

        "Question": "A patient who is being treated for pneumonia starts complaining of sudden shortness of breath. An arterial blood gas (ABG) is drawn. The ABG has the following values: pH 7.21, PaCO2  64 mm Hg, HCO3 = 24 mm Hg. What does the ABG reflect?",
        "Choice 1": "Respiratory acidosis",
        "Choice 2": "Metabolic alkalosis",
        "Choice 3": "Respiratory alkalosis",
        "Choice 4": "Metabolic acidosis",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe pH is below 7.40, PaCO2 is greater than 40, and the HCO3 is normal; therefore, it is a respiratory acidosis, and compensation by the kidneys has not begun, which indicates this was probably an acute event. The HCO3 of 24 is within the normal range so it is not metabolic alkalosis. The pH of 7.21 indicates an acidosis, not alkalosis. The pH of 7.21 indicates it is an acidosis but the HCO3 of 24 is within the normal range, ruling out metabolic acidosis."

        "Question": "One day after a patient is admitted to the medical unit, you note that the patient is oliguric. You notify the acute-care nurse practitioner who orders a fluid challenge of 200 mL of normal saline solution over 15 minutes. This intervention will achieve which of the following?",
        "Choice 1": "Help distinguish hyponatremia from hypernatremia",
        "Choice 2": "Help evaluate pituitary gland function",
        "Choice 3": "Help distinguish reduced renal blood flow from decreased renal function",
        "Choice 4": "Help provide an effective treatment for hypertension-induced oliguria",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIf a patient is not excreting enough urine, the health care provider needs to determine whether the depressed renal function is the result of reduced renal blood flow, which is a fluid volume deficit (FVD or prerenal azotemia), or acute tubular necrosis that results in necrosis or cellular death from prolonged FVD. A typical example of a fluid challenge involves administering 100 to 200 mL of normal saline solution over 15 minutes. The response by a patient with FVD but with normal renal function is increased urine output and an increase in blood pressure. Laboratory examinations are needed to distinguish hyponatremia from hypernatremia. A fluid challenge is not used to evaluate pituitary gland function. A fluid challenge may provide information regarding hypertension-induced oliguria, but it is not an effective treatment."

The nurse notes that the woman seems uncharacteristically confused and has dry mucous membranes. When asked about her fluid intake, the patient states, “I stop drinking water early in the day because it is just too difficult to get up during the night to go to the bathroom.” What would be the nurse's best response?",
        "Choice 1": "“I will need to have your medications adjusted so you will need to be readmitted to the hospital for a complete workup.”",
        "Choice 2": "“Limiting your fluids can create imbalances in your body that can result in confusion. Maybe we need to adjust the timing of your fluids.”",

        "Question": "A 73-year-old man comes into the emergency department (ED) by ambulance after slipping on a small carpet in his home. The patient fell on his hip with a resultant fracture. He is alert and oriented; his pupils are equal and reactive to light and accommodation. His heart rate is elevated, he is anxious and thirsty, a Foley catheter is placed, and 40 mL of urine is present. What is the nurse's most likely explanation for the low urine output?",
        "Choice 1": "The man urinated prior to his arrival to the ED and will probably not need to have the Foley catheter kept in place.",
        "Choice 2": "The man likely has a traumatic brain injury, lacks antidiuretic hormone (ADH), and needs vasopressin.",
        "Choice 3": "The man is experiencing symptoms of heart failure and is releasing atrial natriuretic peptide that results in decreased urine output.",
        "Choice 4": "The man is having a sympathetic reaction, which has stimulated the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system that results in diminished urine output.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nRenin is released by the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidneys in response to decreased renal perfusion. Angiotensin-converting enzyme converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II, with its vasoconstrictor properties, increases arterial perfusion pressure and stimulates thirst. As the sympathetic nervous system is stimulated, aldosterone is released in response to an increased release of renin, which decreases urine production. Based on the nursing assessment and mechanism of injury, this is the most likely causing the lower urine output. The man urinating prior to his arrival to the ED is unlikely; the fall and hip injury would make his ability to urinate difficult. No assessment information indicates he has a head injury or heart failure."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIncreased serum sodium causes increased thirst and the release of ADH by the posterior pituitary gland. When serum osmolality decreases and thirst and ADH secretions are suppressed, the kidney excretes more water to restore normal osmolality. Levels of potassium, hemoglobin, and platelets do not directly affect ADH release."

What is the new nurse's best response?",
        "Choice 1": "The patient's calcium will rise dramatically due to pituitary stimulation.",
        "Choice 2": "Oxygen will increase the patient's intracranial pressure and create confusion.",
        "Choice 3": "Oxygen may cause the patient to hyperventilate and become acidotic.",
        "Choice 4": "Using oxygen may result in the patient developing carbon dioxide narcosis and hypoxemia.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nWhen PaCO2 chronically exceeds 50 mm Hg, it creates insensitivity to CO2 in the respiratory medulla, and the use of oxygen may result in the patient developing carbon dioxide narcosis and hypoxemia. No information indicates the patient's calcium will rise dramatically due to pituitary stimulation. No feedback system that oxygen stimulates would create an increase in the patient's intracranial pressure and create confusion. Increasing the oxygen would not stimulate the patient to hyperventilate and become acidotic; rather, it would cause hypoventilation and acidosis."

        "Question": "The nurse is providing care for a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. When describing the process of respiration the nurse explains how oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged between the pulmonary capillaries and the alveoli. The nurse is describing what process?",
        "Choice 1": "Diffusion",
        "Choice 2": "Osmosis",
        "Choice 3": "Active transport",
        "Choice 4": "Filtration",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nDiffusion is the natural tendency of a substance to move from an area of higher concentration to one of lower concentration. It occurs through the random movement of ions and molecules. Examples of diffusion are the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the pulmonary capillaries and alveoli and the tendency of sodium to move from the ECF compartment, where the sodium concentration is high, to the ICF, where its concentration is low. Osmosis occurs when two different solutions are separated by a membrane that is impermeable to the dissolved substances; fluid shifts through the membrane from the region of low solute concentration to the region of high solute concentration until the solutions are of equal concentration. Active transport implies that energy must be expended for the movement to occur against a concentration gradient. Movement of water and solutes occurring from an area of high hydrostatic pressure to an area of low hydrostatic pressure is filtration."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAn example of filtration is the passage of water and electrolytes from the arterial capillary bed to the interstitial fluid; in this instance, the hydrostatic pressure results from the pumping action of the heart. Active transport does not move water and electrolytes from the arterial capillary bed to the interstitial fluid, filtration does. The number of dissolved particles in a unit of blood is concerned with osmolality. The pressure in the renal capillaries causes renal filtration."

The patient reports pain at the incision site rated at a 3 on a 0-to-10 rating scale. During your initial shift assessment, the patient complains of cramps in her legs and a tingling sensation in her feet. Your assessment indicates decreased deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) and you suspect the patient has hypokalemia. What other sign or symptom would you expect this patient to exhibit?",

If prolonged, hypokalemia can lead to an inability of the kidneys to concentrate urine, causing dilute urine (resulting in polyuria, nocturia) and excessive thirst. Potassium depletion suppresses the release of insulin and results in glucose intolerance. Decreased muscle strength and DTRs can be found on physical assessment. You would expect decreased, not increased, muscle strength with hypokalemia. The patient would not have diarrhea following bowel surgery, and increased bowel motility is inconsistent with hypokalemia."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nH2 receptor antagonists, such as cimetidine (Tagamet), reduce the production of gastric HCl, thereby decreasing the metabolic alkalosis associated with gastric suction. Maalox is an oral simethicone used to break up gas in the GI system and would be of no benefit in treating a patient in metabolic alkalosis. KCl would only be given if the patient were hypokalemic, which is not stated in the scenario. Furosemide (Lasix) would only be given if the patient were fluid overloaded, which is not stated in the scenario."

The patient appears malnourished and on day 3 of the patient's admission total parenteral nutrition (TPN) has been started. Why would you know to start the infusion of TPN slowly?",
        "Choice 1": "Patients receiving TPN are at risk for hypercalcemia if calories are started too rapidly.",
        "Choice 2": "Malnourished patients receiving parenteral nutrition are at risk for hypophosphatemia if calories are started too aggressively.",
        "Choice 3": "Malnourished patients who receive fluids too rapidly are at risk for hypernatremia.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe nurse identifies patients who are at risk for hypophosphatemia and monitors them. Because malnourished patients receiving parenteral nutrition are at risk when calories are introduced too aggressively, preventive measures involve gradually introducing the solution to avoid rapid shifts of phosphorus into the cells. Patients receiving TPN are not at risk for hypercalcemia or hypernatremia if calories or fluids are started to rapidly. Digestive enzymes are not a relevant consideration."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nNeurogenic shock can be caused by spinal cord injury. The patient will present with a low blood pressure; bradycardia; and warm, dry skin due to the loss of sympathetic muscle tone and increased parasympathetic stimulation. Anaphylactic shock is caused by an identifiable offending agent, such as a bee sting. Septic shock is caused by bacteremia in the blood and presents with a tachycardia.

        "Question": "The intensive care nurse caring for a patient in shock is planning assessments and interventions related to the patient's nutritional needs. What physiologic process contributes to these increased nutritional needs?",
        "Choice 1": "The use of albumin as an energy source by the body because of the need for increased adenosine triphosphate (ATP)",
        "Choice 2": "The loss of fluids due to decreased skin integrity and decreased stomach acids due to increased parasympathetic activity",
        "Choice 3": "The release of catecholamines that creates an increase in metabolic rate and caloric requirements",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nNutritional support is an important aspect of care for patients in shock. Patients in shock may require 3,000 calories daily. This caloric need is directly related to the release of catecholamines and the resulting increase in metabolic rate and caloric requirements. Albumin is not primarily metabolized as an energy source. The special nutritional needs of shock are not related to increased parasympathetic activity, but are instead related to increased sympathetic activity. GI function does not increase during shock."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nShock is a life-threatening condition with a variety of underlying causes. It is critical that the nurse apply the nursing process as the guide for care. Shock is unpredictable and rapidly changing so the nurse must understand the underlying mechanisms of shock. The nurse must also be able to recognize the subtle as well as more obvious signs and then provide rapid assessment and response to provide the patient with the best chance for recovery. Coping skills are important, but not the ultimate priority. Keeping the physician updated with the most accurate information is important, but the nurse is in the best position to provide rapid assessment and response, which gives the patient the best chance for survival. Monitoring for significant changes is critical, and evaluating patient outcomes is always a part of the nursing process, but the subtle signs and symptoms of shock are as important as the more obvious signs, such as blood pressure and skin temperature. Assessment must lead to diagnosis and interventions."

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPromoting communication with the patient and family is a critical role of the nurse with a patient in progressive shock. It is also important that the health care team address end-of-life decisions to ensure that supportive therapies are congruent with the patient's wishes. Many cases of MODS result in death and the life expectancy of patients with MODS is usually measured in hours and possibly days, but not in months.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nDuring hypovolemic shock, a state of hypernatremia occurs. Hypernatremia stimulates the release of ADH by the pituitary gland. ADH causes the kidneys to retain water further in an effort to raise blood volume and blood pressure. In a hypovolemic state the body shifts blood away from anything that is not a vital organ, so hunger is not an issue; thirst is increased as the body tries to increase fluid volume; and capillary profusion decreases as the body shunts blood away from the periphery and to the vital organs."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nWhen vasoactive medications are administered, vital signs must be monitored frequently (at least every 15 minutes until stable, or more often if indicated). Vasoactive medications should be administered through a central venous line because infiltration and extravasation of some vasoactive medications can cause tissue necrosis and sloughing. An IV pump should be used to ensure that the medications are delivered safely and accurately. Individual medication dosages are usually titrated by the nurse, who adjusts drip rates based on the prescribed dose and the patient's response. Reviewing medications, performing a focused cardiovascular assessment, and providing patient education are important nursing tasks, but they are not specific to the administration of IV vasoactive drugs. Reviewing the laboratory findings, monitoring urine output, and assessing for peripheral edema are not the priorities for administration of IV vasoactive drugs. Vital signs are taken on a frequent basis when monitoring administration of IV vasoactive drugs, vasoactive medications should be administered through a central venous line, and early discharge instructions would be inappropriate in this time of crisis."

The nurse's assessment reveals that the patient has a normal blood pressure, increased heart rate, decreased bowel sounds, and cold, clammy skin. The nurse's analysis of these data should lead to what preliminary conclusion?",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIn the compensatory stage of shock, the blood pressure remains within normal limits. Vasoconstriction, increased heart rate, and increased contractility of the heart contribute to maintaining adequate cardiac output. Patients display the often-described “fight or flight” response. The body shunts blood from organs such as the skin, kidneys, and GI tract to the brain and heart to ensure adequate blood supply to these vital organs. As a result, the skin is cool and clammy, and bowel sounds are hypoactive. In progressive shock, the blood pressure drops. In septic shock, the patient's chance of survival is low and he will certainly not be released within 24 hours.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe irreversible (or refractory) stage of shock represents the point along the shock continuum at which organ damage is so severe that the patient does not respond to treatment and cannot survive. Providing opportunities for the family to spend time with the patient and helping them to understand the irreversible stage of shock is the best intervention. Informing the patient's family early that the patient will likely not survive does allow the family to make plans and move forward, but informing the family too early will rob the family of hope and interrupt the grieving process. The chance of surviving the irreversible (or refractory) stage of shock is very small, and the nurse needs to help the family cope with the reality of the situation.

There is no consensus regarding whether crystalloids or colloids, such as dextran and albumin, should be used; however, with crystalloids, more fluid is necessary to restore intravascular volume. Albumin is very expensive and is a blood product so it is not always readily available for use. Dextran does increase intravascular volume, but it increases the risk for coagulopathy. Lactated Ringer's is a good solution choice because it increases volume and buffers acidosis, but it should not be used in patients with liver failure because the liver is unable to covert lactate to bicarbonate."

The nurse is aware that patients in shock possess excess energy requirements. What would be the main challenge in meeting this patient's elevated energy requirements during prolonged rehabilitation?",
        "Choice 1": "Loss of adipose tissue",
        "Choice 2": "Loss of skeletal muscle",
        "Choice 3": "Inability to convert adipose tissue to energy",
        "Choice 4": "Inability to maintain normal body mass",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nNutritional energy requirements are met by breaking down lean body mass. In this catabolic process, skeletal muscle mass is broken down even when the patient has large stores of fat or adipose tissue. Loss of skeletal muscle greatly prolongs the patient's recovery time. Loss of adipose tissue, the inability to convert adipose tissue to energy, and the inability to maintain normal body mass are not main concerns in meeting nutritional energy requirements for this patient."

        "Question": "A public health nurse has formed an interdisciplinary team that is developing an educational program entitled Cancer: The Risks and What You Can Do About Them. Participants will receive information, but the major focus will be screening for relevant cancers. This program is an example of what type of health promotion activity?",
        "Choice 1": "Disease prophylaxis",
        "Choice 2": "Risk reduction",
        "Choice 3": "Secondary prevention",
        "Choice 4": "Tertiary prevention",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nSecondary prevention involves screening and early detection activities that seek to identify early stage cancer in individuals who lack signs and symptoms suggestive of cancer. Primary prevention is concerned with reducing the risks of disease through health promotion strategies. Tertiary prevention is the care and rehabilitation of the patient after having been diagnosed with cancer."

        "Question": "A 62-year-old woman diagnosed with breast cancer is scheduled for a partial mastectomy. The oncology nurse explained that the surgeon will want to take tissue samples to ensure the disease has not spread to adjacent axillary lymph nodes. The patient has asked if she will have her lymph nodes dissected, like her mother did several years ago. What alternative to lymph node dissection will this patient most likely undergo?",
        "Choice 1": "Lymphadenectomy",
        "Choice 2": "Needle biopsy",
        "Choice 3": "Open biopsy",
        "Choice 4": "Sentinel node biopsy",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nSentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), also known as sentinel lymph node mapping, is a minimally invasive surgical approach that, in some instances, has replaced more invasive lymph node dissections (lymphadenectomy) and their associated complications such as lymphedema and delayed healing. SLNB has been widely adopted for regional lymph node staging in selected cases of melanoma and breast cancer."

        "Question": "You are caring for a patient who has just been told that her stage IV colon cancer has recurred and metastasized to the liver. The oncologist offers the patient the option of surgery to treat the progression of this disease. What type of surgery does the oncologist offer?",
        "Choice 1": "Palliative",
        "Choice 2": "Reconstructive",
        "Choice 3": "Salvage",
        "Choice 4": "Prophylactic",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nWhen cure is not possible, the goals of treatment are to make the patient as comfortable as possible and to promote quality of life as defined by the patient and his or her family. Palliative surgery is performed in an attempt to relieve complications of cancer, such as ulceration, obstruction, hemorrhage, pain, and malignant effusion. Reconstructive surgery may follow curative or radical surgery in an attempt to improve function or obtain a more desirable cosmetic effect. Salvage surgery is an additional treatment option that uses an extensive surgical approach to treat the local recurrence of a cancer after the use of a less extensive primary approach. Prophylactic surgery involves removing nonvital tissues or organs that are at increased risk to develop cancer."

The nurse enters the room and finds the patient struggling to breath and the nurse's rapid assessment reveals that the patient's jugular veins are distended. The nurse should suspect the development of what oncologic emergency?",
        "Choice 1": "Increased intracranial pressure",
        "Choice 2": "Superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS)",
        "Choice 3": "Spinal cord compression",
        "Choice 4": "Metastatic tumor of the neck",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nSVCS occurs when there is gradual or sudden impaired venous drainage giving rise to progressive shortness of breath (dyspnea), cough, hoarseness, chest pain, and facial swelling; edema of the neck, arms, hands, and thorax and reported sensation of skin tightness and difficulty swallowing; as well as possibly engorged and distended jugular, temporal, and arm veins. Increased intracranial pressure may be a part of SVCS, but it is not what is causing the patient's symptoms. The scenario does not mention a problem with the patient's spinal cord. The scenario says that the cancer has metastasized, but not that it has metastasized to the neck."

        "Choice 4": "Restrict calcium intake.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe nurse should identify patients at risk for hypercalcemia, assess for signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia, and educate the patient and family. The nurse should teach at-risk patients to recognize and report signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia and encourage patients to consume 2 to 4 L of fluid daily unless contraindicated by existing renal or cardiac disease. Also, the nurse should explain the use of dietary and pharmacologic interventions, such as stool softeners and laxatives for constipation, and advise patients to maintain nutritional intake without restricting normal calcium intake."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPostoperatively, the nurse assesses the patient's responses to the surgery and monitors the patient for possible complications, such as infection, bleeding, thrombophlebitis, wound dehiscence, fluid and electrolyte imbalance, and organ dysfunction. Fine motor skills are unlikely to be affected by surgery and compartment syndrome is a complication of fracture casting, not abdominal surgery. There is no need to maintain a high head of bed."

        "Choice 4": "Administer the medication rectally.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nA change in medication route is indicated and must be made by a physician's order. Many pain medications cannot be crushed and given to a patient.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nMany dilemmas in patient care at the end of life are related to poor communication between team members and the patient and family, as well as to failure of team members to communicate with each other effectively. Regardless of the care setting, the nurse can ensure a proactive approach to the psychosocial care of the patient and family. Denial of death may be a response to the situation, but it is not classified as a need. Visitation should accommodate wishes of the family member as long as patient care is not compromised."

Seriously ill patients and their families need time and support to cope with the changes brought about by serious illness and the prospect of impending death. The nurse who is able to listen without judging and without trying to solve the patient's and family's problems provides an invaluable intervention. The patient needs to feel that people are concerned with his situation. Leaving him does not show acceptance of his feelings. Offering to call pastoral care may be helpful for some patients, but should be done after you have spent time with the patient. Telling the patient that you understand how he is feeling is inappropriate because it does not help him express his feelings."

What intervention has the highest priority?",
        "Choice 1": "Allowing the patient to express her feelings without judging her",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nListening to the patient express her feelings openly without judging her is the highest priority. The nurse should not impose his or her own values on the patient. The nurse should also help the patient to understand the grieving process and use all the support systems that are available to assist her in coping with this situation.

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIn addition to assessment of the role of religious faith and practices, important religious rituals, and connection to a religious community, you should further explore the presence or absence of a sense of peace of mind and purpose in life; other sources of meaning, hope, and comfort; and spiritual or religious beliefs about illness, medical treatment, and care of the sick.

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPalliative care, which is conceptually broader than hospice care, is both an approach to care and a structured system for care delivery that aims to prevent and relieve suffering and to support the best possible quality of life for patients and their families, regardless of the stage of the disease or the need for other therapies. Palliative care goes beyond simple prioritization of emotional needs; these are always considered and addressed. Palliative care is considered a “bridge,” but it is not limited to just hospice care.

Multidisciplinary care refers to participation of clinicians with varied backgrounds and skill sets, but without coordination and integration.

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nRegulations that govern how care in these facilities is organized and reimbursed tend to emphasize restorative measures and serve as a disincentive to palliative care.

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPhysicians are reluctant to refer patients to hospice, and patients are reluctant to accept this form of care. Reasons include the difficulties in making a terminal prognosis (especially for those patients with noncancer diagnoses), the strong association of hospice with death, advances in “curative” treatment options in late-stage illness, and financial pressures on health care providers that may cause them to retain rather than refer hospice-eligible patients."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nHistorical mistrust of the health care system and unequal access to even basic medical care may underlie the beliefs and attitudes among ethnically diverse populations. In addition, lack of education or knowledge about end-of-life care treatment options and language barriers influence decisions among many socioeconomically disadvantaged groups.

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nBecause of Medicare rules concerning completion of all cure-focused medical treatment before the Medicare hospice benefit may be accessed, many patients delay enrollment in hospice programs until very close to the end of life. Hospice care does not include an unwillingness to medicate the patient to keep him or her from suffering. Patients must accept that they are terminal before being admitted to hospice care.

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIn many settings, staff members organize or attend memorial services to support families and other caregivers who find comfort in joining each other to remember and celebrate the lives of patients. Taking time off should not be necessary and posting mementos would be inappropriate. It would be highly inappropriate to solicit emotional support from the patient's family during their time of loss."

Preoperative teaching is initiated as soon as possible, beginning in the physician's office, clinic, or at the time of preadmission testing when diagnostic tests are performed. Upon admission to the PACU, the patient is usually drowsy, making this an inopportune time for teaching. Upon the patient's return from the PACU, the patient may remain drowsy.

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nExercise of the extremities includes extension and flexion of the knee and hip joints (similar to bicycle riding while lying on the side) unless contraindicated by type of surgical procedure (e.g., hip replacement). When the patient does leg exercises postoperatively, circulation is increased, which helps to prevent blood clots from forming. Leg exercises do not prevent pressure sores to the sacrum, or increase the patient's level of consciousness. Leg exercises have the potential to increase strength and mobility, but are unlikely to make a change to muscle mass in the short term."

The surgeon must also inform the patient of the benefits, alternatives, possible risks, complications, disfigurement, disability, and removal of body parts as well as what to expect in the early and late postoperative periods. The nurse clarifies the information provided, and, if the patient requests additional information, the nurse notifies the physician.

My surgery is on my hip, not my chest.” What rationale for these instructions should the nurse provide?",
        "Choice 1": "To prevent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)",
        "Choice 2": "To promote optimal lung expansion",
        "Choice 3": "To enhance peripheral circulation",
        "Choice 4": "To prevent pneumothorax",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nOne goal of preoperative nursing care is to teach the patient how to promote optimal lung expansion and consequent blood oxygenation after anesthesia. COPD is not a realistic risk and pneumothorax is also unlikely. Breathing exercises do not primarily affect peripheral circulation."

        "Question": "One of the things a nurse has taught to a patient during preoperative teaching is to have nothing by mouth for the specified time before surgery. The patient asks the nurse why this is important. What is the most appropriate response for the patient?",
        "Choice 1": "“You will need to have food and fluid restricted before surgery so you are not at risk for choking.”",
        "Choice 2": "“The restriction of food or fluid will prevent the development of pneumonia related to decreased lung capacity.”",
        "Choice 3": "“The presence of food in the stomach interferes with the absorption of anesthetic agents.”",
        "Choice 4": "“By withholding food for 8 hours before surgery, you will not develop constipation in the postoperative period.”",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe major purpose of withholding food and fluid before surgery is to prevent aspiration. There is no scientific basis for withholding food and the development of pneumonia or interference with absorption of anesthetic agents. Constipation in patients in the postoperative period is related to the anesthesia, not from withholding food or fluid in the hours before surgery."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe underlying principle that guides the preoperative assessment, surgical care, and postoperative care is that elderly patients have less physiologic reserve (the ability of an organ to return to normal after a disturbance in its equilibrium) than do younger patients. Elderly patients do not have larger lung capacities than younger patients. Elderly patients cannot necessarily cope better than younger patients and they often require lower doses of medications."

        "Choice 1": "Performing documentation",
        "Choice 2": "Estimating the patient's blood loss",
        "Choice 3": "Setting up the sterile tables",
        "Choice 4": "Keeping track of drains and sponges",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nMain responsibilities of the circulating nurse include verifying consent; coordinating the team; and ensuring cleanliness, proper temperature and humidity, lighting, safe function of equipment, and the availability of supplies and materials. The circulating nurse monitors aseptic practices to avoid breaks in technique while coordinating the movement of related personnel as well as implementing fire safety precautions. The circulating nurse also monitors the patient and documents specific activities throughout the operation to ensure the patient's safety and well-being. Estimating the patient's blood loss is the surgeon's responsibility; setting up the sterile tables is the responsibility of the first scrub; and keeping track of the drains and sponges is the joint responsibility of the circulating nurse and the scrub nurse."

        "Question": "A 21-year-old patient is positioned on the OR bed prior to knee surgery to correct a sports-related injury. The anesthesiologist administers the appropriate anesthetic. The OR nurse should anticipate which of the following events as the team's next step in the care of this patient?",
        "Choice 1": "Grounding",
        "Choice 2": "Making the first incision",
        "Choice 3": "Giving blood",
        "Choice 4": "Intubating",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nWhen the patient arrives in the OR, the anesthesiologist or anesthetist reassesses the patient's physical condition immediately prior to initiating anesthesia. The anesthetic is administered, and the patient's airway is maintained through an intranasal intubation, oral intubation, or a laryngeal mask airway. Grounding or blood administration does not normally follow anesthetic administration immediately. An incision would not be made prior to intubation."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nElderly patients are at greatest risk during surgical procedures because they have an impaired ability to increase their metabolic rate and impaired thermoregulatory mechanisms, which increase susceptibility to hypothermia. The other patients are likely at a lower risk."

        "Choice 4": "Difficulty falling asleep",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nDue to the increased number of patients with latex allergies, it is essential to identify this allergy early on so precautions can be taken in the OR. The anesthetist should be informed of any allergies. This is a priority over pregnancy history, insomnia, or recent bowel function, though some of these may be relevant."

        "Choice 1": "The tube provides an airway for ventilation.",
        "Choice 2": "The tube protects the patient's esophagus from trauma.",
        "Choice 3": "The patient may receive an antiemetic through the tube.",
        "Choice 4": "The patient's vital signs can be monitored with the tube.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe anesthetic is administered and the patient's airway is maintained through an intranasal intubation, oral intubation, or a laryngeal mask airway. The tube also helps protect aspiration of stomach contents. The tube does not protect the esophagus. Because the tube goes into the lungs, no medications are given through the tube. The patient's vital signs are not monitored through the tube."

        "Choice 1": "The patient must never be left unattended by the nurse.",
        "Choice 2": "The patient should begin a course of antiemetics the day before surgery.",
        "Choice 3": "The patient should be informed that he or she will remember most of the procedure.",
        "Choice 4": "The patient must be able to maintain his or her own airway.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe patient receiving moderate sedation should never be left unattended. The patient's ability to maintain his or her airway depends on the level of sedation. The administration of moderate sedation is not a counter indication for giving an antiemetic. The patient receiving moderate sedation does not remember most of the procedure."

        "Choice 1": "Have the patient sit in a chair and perform deep breathing exercises.",
        "Choice 2": "Ambulate the patient as early as possible.",
        "Choice 3": "Limit the patient's fluid intake for the first 24 hours postoperatively.",
        "Choice 4": "Keep the patient positioned supine.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nMeasures that increase cerebrospinal pressure are helpful in relieving headache. These include maintaining a quiet environment, keeping the patient lying flat, and keeping the patient well hydrated. Having the patient sit or stand up decreases cerebrospinal pressure and would not relieve a spinal headache. Limiting fluids is incorrect because it also decreases cerebrospinal pressure and would not relieve a spinal headache."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nA transsacral block produces anesthesia for the perineum and lower abdomen. Both a thoracotomy and breast reduction are in the chest region, and a transsacral block would not provide pain control for these procedures. A closed reduction of a right humerus is a procedure on the right arm, and a transsacral block would not provide pain control."

        "Choice 4": "The preoperative shave should be done by the circulating nurse.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe vascular supply should not be obstructed by an awkward position or undue pressure on a body part. During surgical procedures, the patient is at risk for impairment of skin integrity due to a stationary position and immobility. An elderly patient is at an increased risk of injury and impaired skin integrity. A Trendelenburg position is not indicated for this patient. Once anesthetized for a total hip replacement, the patient cannot move; restraints are not necessary. A preoperative shave is not performed; excess hair is removed by means of a clipper."

        "Choice 1": "The patient may be experiencing presurgical anxiety.",
        "Choice 2": "The patient may be at risk for malignant hyperthermia.",
        "Choice 3": "The grandmother's surgery has minimal relevance to the patient's surgery.",
        "Choice 4": "The patient may be at risk for a sudden onset of postsurgical infection.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nMalignant hyperthermia is an inherited muscle disorder chemically induced by anesthetic agents. Identifying patients at risk is imperative because the mortality rate is 50%. The patient's anxiety is not relevant, the grandmother's surgery is very relevant, and all patients are at risk for hypothermia."

        "Choice 3": "Report the comment immediately to a supervisor.",
        "Choice 4": "Realize that humor is needed in the workplace.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPatients, whether conscious or unconscious, should not be subjected to excess noise, inappropriate conversation, or, most of all, derogatory comments. The nurse must act as an advocate on behalf of the patient and discourage any such remarks. Reporting to a supervisor, however, is not likely necessary."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nLying flat reduces the risk of headache after spinal anesthesia. Hypotension and respiratory depression may be adverse effects of spinal anesthesia associated with the spread of the anesthetic, but lying flat does not help reduce these effects. Pain at the lumbar injection site typically is not a problem."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nSterile surfaces or articles may touch other sterile surfaces or articles and remain sterile; contact with unsterile objects at any point renders a sterile area contaminated. The sterile gauze became contaminated when it was dropped on the patient's abdomen. It should be discarded and new Iodoform gauze should be used to pack the wound.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nWhenever a sterile barrier is breached, the area must be considered contaminated. Pouring solution onto a sterile field cloth violates surgical asepsis because moisture penetrating the cloth can carry microorganisms to the sterile field via capillary action. The other options are practices that help ensure surgical asepsis."

        "Choice 3": "Peudental block",
        "Choice 4": "Paravertebral block",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nExamples of common local conduction blocks include paravertebral anesthesia, which produces anesthesia of the nerves supplying the chest, abdominal wall, and extremities; brachial plexus block, which produces anesthesia of the arm; and transsacral (caudal) block, which produces anesthesia of the perineum and, occasionally, the lower abdomen. A peudental block was used in obstetrics before the almost-routine use of epidural anesthesia."

        "Question": "When creating plans of nursing care for patients who are undergoing surgery using general anesthetic, what nursing diagnoses should the nurse identify? Select all that apply.",
        "Choice 1": "Disturbed sensory perception related to anesthetic",
        "Choice 2": "Risk for impaired nutrition: less than body requirements related to anesthesia",
        "Choice 3": "Risk of latex allergy response related to surgical exposure",

        "Choice 5": "Anxiety related to surgical concerns",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "A,C,E",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nBased on the assessment data, some major nursing diagnoses may include the following: anxiety related to surgical or environmental concerns, risk of latex allergy response due to possible exposure to latex in the OR environment, risk for perioperative positioning injury related to positioning in the OR, risk for injury related to anesthesia and surgical procedure, or disturbed sensory perception (global) related to general anesthesia or sedation. Malnutrition and disturbed body image are much less likely."

        "Question": "The intraoperative nurse is implementing a care plan that addresses the surgical patient's risk for vomiting. Interventions that address the potential for vomiting reduce the risk of what subsequent surgical complication?",
        "Choice 1": "Impaired skin integrity",
        "Choice 2": "Hypoxia",
        "Choice 3": "Malignant hyperthermia",
        "Choice 4": "Hypothermia",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIf the patient aspirates vomitus, an asthma-like attack with severe bronchial spasms and wheezing is triggered. Pneumonitis and pulmonary edema can subsequently develop, leading to extreme hypoxia. Vomiting can cause choking, but the question asks about aspirated vomitus. Malignant hyperthermia is an adverse reaction to anesthesia. Aspirated vomitus does not cause hypothermia. Vomiting does not result in impaired skin integrity."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe aging heart and blood vessels have decreased ability to respond to stress. Reduced cardiac output and limited cardiac reserve make the elderly patient vulnerable to changes in circulating volume and blood oxygen levels. There is not an increased risk for hypopnea, hyperkalemia, or hyperphosphatemia because of an aging cardiovascular system."

        "Question": "The nurse knows that elderly patients are at higher risk for complications and adverse outcomes during the intraoperative period. What is the best rationale for this phenomenon?",
        "Choice 1": "The elderly patient has a more angular bone structure than a younger person.",
        "Choice 2": "The elderly patient has reduced ability to adjust rapidly to emotional and physical stress.",
        "Choice 3": "The elderly patient has impaired thermoregulatory mechanisms, which increase susceptibility to hyperthermia.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nFactors that affect the elderly surgical patient in the intraoperative period include the following: impaired ability to increase metabolic rate and impaired thermoregulatory mechanisms increase susceptibility to hypothermia. Bone loss (25% in women, 12% in men) necessitates careful manipulation and positioning during surgery. Reduced ability to adjust rapidly to emotional and physical stress influences surgical outcomes and requires meticulous observation of vital functions. Older adults do not have more angular bones than younger people."

        "Question": "As an intraoperative nurse, you know that the patient's emotional state can influence the outcome of his or her surgical procedure. How would you best reinforce the patient's ability to influence outcome?",
        "Choice 1": "Teach the patient strategies for distraction.",
        "Choice 2": "Pair the patient with another patient who has better coping strategies.",
        "Choice 3": "Incorporate cultural and religious considerations, as appropriate.",
        "Choice 4": "Give the patient antianxiety medication.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nBecause the patient's emotional state remains a concern, the care initiated by preoperative nurses is continued by the intraoperative nursing staff that provides the patient with information and reassurance. The nurse supports coping strategies and reinforces the patient's ability to influence outcomes by encouraging active participation in the plan of care incorporating cultural, ethnic, and religious considerations, as appropriate. “Buddying” a patient is normally inappropriate and distraction may or may not be effective. Nonpharmacologic measures should be prioritized."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nWarmed IV fluids can prevent the development of hypothermia. Applying warmed bags of saline around the patient is not common practice. The patient is not transfused to prevent hypothermia. Blood pressure and heart rate monitoring are important, but do not relate directly to the risk for hypothermia."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nOlder adults are at an increased risk for orthostatic hypotension secondary to age-related changes in vascular tone. The patient should sit up and then stand for 2 to 3 minutes before ambulating to alleviate orthostatic hypotension. The nurse should assess the patient's ability to mobilize safely, but full assessment of range of motion in all joints is not normally necessary.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAtelectasis occurs when the postoperative patient fails to move, cough, and breathe deeply. With good nursing care, this is an avoidable complication, but reduced mobility greatly increases the risk. Anemia occurs rarely and usually in situations where the patient loses a significant amount of blood or continues bleeding postoperatively. Fluid shifts postoperatively may result in dehydration and peripheral edema, but the patient is most at risk for atelectasis."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nRedness, warmth, and tenderness in the incision area should lead the nurse to suspect a postoperative infection. The presence of any invasive device predisposes a patient to infection, but by itself does not indicate infection. An oral temperature of 99.5ºF may not signal infection in a postoperative patient because of the inflammatory process. A normal WBC count ranges from 4,000 to 10,000/mL."

        "Choice 2": "“During the dressing change, I will provide privacy at a time of your choosing, it should not be painful, and you can look at the incision and help with the procedure if you want to.”",
        "Choice 3": "“The dressing change should not be painful, but you can never be sure, and infection is always a concern.”",
        "Choice 4": "“The best time for doing a dressing change is during lunch so we are not interrupted. I will provide privacy, and it should not be painful.”",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nWhen having dressings changed, the patient needs to be informed that the dressing change is a simple procedure with little discomfort; privacy will be provided; and the patient is free to look at the incision or even assist in the dressing change itself. If the patient decides to look at the incision, assurance is given that the incision will shrink as it heals and that the redness will likely fade. Dressing changes should not be painful, but giving pain medication prior to the procedure is always a good preventive measure. Telling the patient that the dressing change “should not be painful, but you can never be sure, and infection is always a concern” does not offer the patient any real information or options and serves only to create fear. The best time for dressing changes is when it is most convenient for the patient; nutrition is important so interrupting lunch is probably a poor choice."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPatients who have surgery that limits mobility are at an increased risk for pulmonary embolism secondary to deep vein thrombosis. The use of an external pneumatic compression stocking significantly reduces the risk by increasing venous return to the heart and limiting blood stasis. The risk of infection or sepsis would not be affected by an external pneumatic compression stocking.

        "Question": "The nurse in the ED is caring for a man who has returned to the ED 4 days after receiving stitches for a knife wound on his hand. The wound is now infected, so the stitches were removed, and the wound is cleaned and packed with gauze. The ED doctor plans to have the man return tomorrow to remove the packing and resuture the wound. You are aware that the wound will now heal by what means?",
        "Choice 1": "Late intention",
        "Choice 2": "Second intention",
        "Choice 3": "Third intention",
        "Choice 4": "First intention",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThird-intention healing or secondary suture is used for deep wounds that either had not been sutured early or that had the suture break down and are resutured later, which is what has happened in this case. Secondary suture brings the two opposing granulation surfaces back together; however, this usually results in a deeper and wider scar. These wounds are also packed postoperatively with moist gauze and covered with a dry, sterile dressing. Late intention is a term that sounds plausible, but is not used in practice. Second intention is when the wound is left open and the wound is filled with granular tissue. First intention wounds are wounds made aseptically with a minimum of tissue destruction."

        "Question": "The nurse is caring for an 82-year-old female patient in the PACU. The woman begins to awaken and responds to her name, but is confused, restless, and agitated. What principle should guide the nurse's subsequent assessment?",
        "Choice 1": "Postoperative confusion in older adults is an indication of impaired oxygenation or possibly a stroke during surgery.",
        "Choice 2": "Confusion, restlessness, and agitation are expected postoperative findings in older adults and they will diminish in time.",
        "Choice 3": "Postoperative confusion is common in the older adult patent, but it could also indicate a significant blood loss.",
        "Choice 4": "Confusion, restlessness, and agitation indicate an underlying cognitive deficit such as dementia.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPostoperative confusion is common in the older adult patient, but it could also indicate blood loss and the potential for hypovolemic shock; it is a critical symptom for the nurse to identify. Despite being common, it is not considered to be an expected finding. Postoperative confusion is an indication of an oxygen problem or possibly a stroke during surgery, but blood loss is more likely. A new onset of confusion, restlessness, and agitation does not necessarily suggest an underlying cognitive disorder."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe patient with a hemorrhage presents with hypotension; rapid, thready pulse; disorientation; restlessness; oliguria; and cold, pale skin. Aspiration would manifest in airway disturbance. Hypertension or dysrhythmias would be less likely to cause pallor and cool skin. An infection would not be present at this early postoperative stage."

        "Question": "The nursing instructor is discussing postoperative care with a group of nursing students. A student nurse asks, “Why does the patient go to the PACU instead of just going straight up to the postsurgical unit?” What is the nursing instructor's best response?",
        "Choice 1": "“The PACU allows the patient to recover from anesthesia in a stimulating environment to facilitate awakening and reorientation.”",
        "Choice 2": "“The PACU allows the patient to recover from the effects of anesthesia, and the patient stays in the PACU until he or she is oriented, has stable vital signs, and is without complications.”",
        "Choice 3": "“Frequently, patients are placed in the medical–surgical unit to recover, but hospitals are usually short of beds, and the PACU is an excellent place to triage patients.”",
        "Choice 4": "“Patients remain in the PACU for a predetermined time because the surgeon will often need to reinforce or alter the patient's incision in the hours following surgery.”",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe PACU provides care for the patient while he or she recovers from the effects of anesthesia. The patient must be oriented, have stable vital signs, and show no evidence of hemorrhage or other complications. Patients will sometimes recover in the ICU, but this is considered an extension of the PACU. The PACU does allow the patient to recover from anesthesia, but the environment is calm and quiet as patients are initially disoriented and confused as they begin to awaken and reorient. Patients are not usually placed in the medical–surgical unit for recovery and, although hospitals are occasionally short of beds, the PACU is not used for patient triage. Incisions are very rarely modified in the immediate postoperative period."

The nurse looks, listens, and feels for breathing, and determines the patient is not breathing. What is the priority intervention?",
        "Choice 1": "Check the patient's oxygen saturation level, continue to monitor for apnea, and perform a focused assessment.",
        "Choice 2": "Treat the possible airway obstruction by tilting the head back and pushing forward on the angle of the lower jaw.",

        "Choice 4": "Reintubate the patient.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nWhen a nurse finds a patient who is not breathing, the priority intervention is to open the airway and treat a possible hypopharyngeal obstruction. To treat the possible airway obstruction, the nurse tilts the head back and then pushes forward on the angle of the lower jaw or performs the jaw thrust method to open the airway. This is an emergency and requires the basic life support intervention of airway, breathing, and circulation assessment. Arterial pulses should be checked only after airway and breathing have been established. Reintubation and resuscitation would begin after rapidly ruling out a hypopharyngeal obstruction."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nOptimal nutritional status is important for wound healing; the patient should eat plenty of fruits and vegetables and not reduce protein intake. To avoid impeding circulation to the area, the bandage should be secure but not tight. If the patient's foot feels cold, circulation is impaired, which inhibits wound healing."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe primary objective in the immediate postoperative period is to maintain ventilation and, thus, prevent hypoxemia (reduced oxygen in the blood) and hypercapnia (excess carbon dioxide in the blood). Assessing for hemorrhage and assessing vital sign are also important, but constitute second and third priorities. Pain management is important but only after the patient has been stabilized."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe nurse should first place saline-soaked sterile dressings on the open wound to prevent tissue drying and possible infection. Then the nurse should call the physician and take the patient's vital signs. The dehiscence needs to be surgically closed, so the nurse should never try to close it."

Signs and symptoms include agitation; tachypnea; tachycardia; decreased pulse oximetry readings; frothy, pink sputum; and crackles on auscultation. Laryngospasm does not cause crackles or frothy, pink sputum. The patient with atelectasis has decreased breath sounds over the affected area; the scenario does not indicate this.

The nurse's aide reports to you that this patient's vital signs are slightly elevated and that she has a nonproductive cough. When you assess the patient, you auscultate crackles at the base of the lungs. What would you suspect is wrong with your patient?",

        "Choice 4": "Malignant hyperthermia",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nHypostatic pulmonary congestion, caused by a weakened cardiovascular system that permits stagnation of secretions at lung bases, may develop; this condition occurs most frequently in elderly patients who are not mobilized effectively. The symptoms are often vague, with perhaps a slight elevation of temperature, pulse, and respiratory rate, as well as a cough. Physical examination reveals dullness and crackles at the base of the lungs. If the condition progresses, then the outcome may be fatal. A pulmonary embolism does not have this presentation and hypervolemia is unlikely due to the patient's low fluid intake.

Until now, the patient has refused to learn how to change her dressing. What would indicate to the nurse the patient's possible readiness to learn how to change her dressing? Select all that apply.",
        "Choice 1": "The patient wants you to teach a family member to do dressing changes.",
        "Choice 2": "The patient expresses interest in the dressing change.",
        "Choice 3": "The patient is willing to look at the incision during a dressing change.",
        "Choice 4": "The patient expresses dislike of the surgical wound.",
        "Choice 5": "The patient assists in opening the packages of dressing material for the nurse.",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "B,C,E",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nWhile changing the dressing, the nurse has an opportunity to teach the patient how to care for the incision and change the dressings at home. The nurse observes for indicators of the patient's readiness to learn, such as looking at the incision, expressing interest, or assisting in the dressing change. Expressing dislike and wanting to delegate to a family member do not suggest readiness to learn."

        "Choice 1": "“There is a genetic link in the formation of deep vein thrombi.”",
        "Choice 2": "“Hypervolemia is often present in patients who go on to develop deep vein thrombi.”",
        "Choice 3": "“No known factors contribute to the formation of deep vein thrombi; they just occur.”",
        "Choice 4": "“Dehydration is a contributory factor to the formation of deep vein thrombi.”",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe stress response that is initiated by surgery inhibits the fibrinolytic system, resulting in blood hypercoagulability. Dehydration, low cardiac output, blood pooling in the extremities, and bedrest add to the risk of thrombosis formation. Hypervolemia is not a risk factor and there are no known genetic factors."

The patient is day 2 postoperative and has been mentally intact, as per baseline. When the nurse assesses the patient, it is clear that he is confused and has been experiencing disturbed sleep patterns and impaired psychomotor skills. What should the nurse suspect is the problem with the patient?",

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe benefits of early ambulation and leg exercises in preventing DVT cannot be overemphasized, and these activities are recommended for all patients, regardless of their risk. Increasing the head of the bed is not effective. Ambulation is superior to passive range-of-motion exercises. Fluid intake is important, but is less protective than early ambulation."

        "Choice 1": "Request another assignment if there is dissonance with the patient's lifestyle.",
        "Choice 2": "Ask the patient to come to the agency to receive treatment, if possible.",
        "Choice 3": "Resolve to convey respect for the patient's beliefs and choices.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nTo work successfully with patients in any setting, the nurse must be nonjudgmental and convey respect for patients' beliefs, even if they differ sharply from the nurse's. This can be difficult when a patient's lifestyle involves activities that a nurse considers harmful or unacceptable, such as smoking, use of alcohol, drug abuse, or overeating. The nurse should not request another assignment because of a difference in beliefs, nor do nurses ask for the patient to come to you at the agency to receive treatment.

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nInfection control is as important in the home as it is in the hospital, but it can be more challenging in the home and requires creative approaches. As in any situation, it is important to clean one's hands before and after giving direct patient care, even in a home that does not have running water. Removing the wound dressings from the home and disinfecting all work areas in the home are not the best implementations of infection control in the home. Used syringes are never disinfected and a sterile field is not always necessary."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe community-based nurse is responsible for informing the patient and family about the community resources available to meet their needs. During initial and subsequent home visits, the nurse helps the patient and family identify these community services and encourages them to contact the appropriate agencies. When appropriate, nurses may make the initial contact. The other answers are incorrect because it is inappropriate to ever provide information on other patients to a patient. The nurse's credentials are not normally discussed. Giving the patient the dates and times of their scheduled home visits is appropriate, but may not always be possible.

Then the nurse should schedule the visit and verify the address. A physician's order is not necessary to schedule a visit with the patient. The nurse may identify community services or the need for a home health aide after assessing the patient and the home environment during the first visit with the patient.

        "Question": "You are assessing a new patient and his home environment following the patient's referral for community-based care. Which of the following is the most important responsibility that you, as a community-based nurse, have at this initial visit?",
        "Choice 1": "Encourage the patient and his family to become more involved in their community.",
        "Choice 2": "Encourage the patient and his family to delegate someone to contact community resources.",
        "Choice 3": "Encourage the patient and his family to focus primarily on online supports.",
        "Choice 4": "Encourage the patient and his family to connect with appropriate community resources.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nDuring initial and subsequent home visits, the nurse helps the patient and family identify community services and encourages them to contact the appropriate agencies. This is preferable to delegating another person to make contact. When appropriate, nurses may make the initial contact. A home-health nurse would not normally encourage the patient to become more involved in the community as a means of promoting health. Online forms of support can be useful, but they are not the sole form of support that most patients need."

        "Choice 1": "Dieticians",
        "Choice 2": "Ambulatory health care",
        "Choice 3": "Occupational health care",
        "Choice 4": "Hospice care",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAmbulatory health care is provided for patients in community or hospital-based settings. The types of agencies that provide such care are medical clinics, ambulatory care units, urgent care centers, cardiac rehabilitation programs, mental health centers, student health centers, community outreach programs, and nursing centers. Dieticians are not generally community-based and hospice care is not generally provided in hospital settings. Occupational health care is situated in workplaces."

        "Choice 1": "The potential for at-risk working environments",
        "Choice 2": "Self-defense strategies",
        "Choice 3": "Locations of emergency services in the area",
        "Choice 4": "Standard precautions for infection control",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nBased on the principle of due diligence, agencies must inform employees of at-risk working environments. Agencies have policies and procedures concerning the promotion of safety for clinical staff, and training is provided to facilitate personal safety. The physical location of emergency services is not important, though methods for contacting emergency services are a priority. Infection control is part of the nurse's own professional responsibility. Self-defense strategies are not always addressed and are not legally mandated."

        "Choice 1": "Ignore the husband and focus on the patient.",
        "Choice 2": "Return to your agency and notify your supervisor.",
        "Choice 3": "Call the police from your cell phone.",
        "Choice 4": "Remove the patient from the home immediately.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIf a dangerous situation is encountered during a visit, the nurse should return to the agency and contact his or her supervisor or law enforcement officials, or both. Ignoring the husband or calling the police while in the home or attempting to remove the patient from the home could further endanger you and the patient."

        "Choice 1": "An early morning or late afternoon appointment",
        "Choice 2": "An assigned parking space in the neighborhood",
        "Choice 3": "A colleague to accompany the nurse on the visit",
        "Choice 4": "Someone to wait in the car while the nurse makes the visit",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nWhen making visits in high-crime areas, visit with another person rather than alone. A person who is waiting in the car is of little benefit. An early morning or late afternoon appointment would not necessarily guarantee safety. Similarly, assigned parking would not guarantee the nurse's safety while performing the visit."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nNurses in community-based practice provide preventive care at three levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Tertiary prevention focuses on minimizing deterioration and improving quality of life, including rehabilitation to assist patients in achieving their maximum potential by working through their physical or psychological challenges. Home care nurses often focus on tertiary preventive nursing care, although primary and secondary prevention are also addressed. Preventive care is an umbrella term for all three levels of care."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "A,B,D",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe development of a comprehensive discharge plan requires collaboration with professionals at both the referring agency and the home care agency, as well as other community agencies that provide specific resources upon discharge. The pharmacy technician does not participate in discharge planning and there is no indication that Meals-on-Wheels are necessary."

While performing the dressing change, the nurse realizes that she forgot to bring the adhesive gauze specified in the wound care regimen. What is the nurse's best action?",
        "Choice 1": "Phone a colleague to bring the required supplies as soon as possible.",
        "Choice 2": "Improvise, if possible, using sterile gauze and adhesive tape.",
        "Choice 3": "Leave the wound open to air and teach the patient about infection control.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nImprovisation is a necessity in many home health situations. It would be logistically difficult to have the supplies delivered and leaving the wound open to air may be contraindicated. A return visit the next day does not resolve the immediate problem."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nMany home health care expenditures are financed by Medicare, which allows nurses to manage and evaluate patient care for seriously ill patients who have complex, labile conditions and are at high risk for rehospitalization. Home health nurses, despite who funds their visits, do not provide care without the oversight of a physician; they do not normally write medication orders; nor do they order the services of ancillary specialists such as physical, occupational, or speech therapists."

        "Choice 2": "Accurate documentation ensures that the agency is correctly reimbursed for the visit.",
        "Choice 3": "Accurate documentation allows the patient to gauge his or her progress over time.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe arterial oxygen tension (partial pressure or PaO2) indicates the degree of oxygenation of the blood, and the arterial carbon dioxide tension (partial pressure or PaCO2) indicates the adequacy of alveolar ventilation. ABG studies aid in assessing the ability of the lungs to provide adequate oxygen and remove carbon dioxide and the ability of the kidneys to reabsorb or excrete bicarbonate ions to maintain normal body pH. Capillary blood samples are venous blood, not arterial blood, so they are not as accurate as an ABG. Pulse oximetry is a useful clinical tool but does not replace ABG measurement, because it is not as accurate. A CBC does not indicate the concentration of oxygen."

        "Question": "A patient with chronic lung disease is undergoing lung function testing. What test result denotes the volume of air inspired and expired with a normal breath?",
        "Choice 1": "Total lung capacity",
        "Choice 2": "Forced vital capacity",
        "Choice 3": "Tidal volume",
        "Choice 4": "Residual volume",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nTidal volume refers to the volume of air inspired and expired with a normal breath. Total lung capacity is the maximal amount of air the lungs and respiratory passages can hold after a forced inspiration. Forced vital capacity is vital capacity performed with a maximally forced expiration. Residual volume is the maximal amount of air left in the lung after a maximal expiration."

        "Question": "In addition to heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and temperature, the nurse needs to assess a patient's arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2). What procedure will best accomplish this?",
        "Choice 1": "Incentive spirometry",
        "Choice 2": "Arterial blood gas (ABG) measurement",
        "Choice 3": "Peak flow measurement",
        "Choice 4": "Pulse oximetry",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPulse oximetry is a noninvasive procedure in which a small sensor is positioned over a pulsating vascular bed. It can be used during transport and causes the patient no discomfort. An incentive spirometer is used to assist the patient with deep breathing after surgery. ABG measurement can measure SaO2, but this is an invasive procedure that can be painful. Some patients with asthma use peak flow meters to measure levels of expired air."

        "Question": "A patient asks the nurse why an infection in his upper respiratory system is affecting the clarity of his speech. Which structure serves as the patient's resonating chamber in speech?",
        "Choice 1": "Trachea",
        "Choice 2": "Pharynx",
        "Choice 3": "Paranasal sinuses",
        "Choice 4": "Larynx",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nA prominent function of the sinuses is to serve as a resonating chamber in speech. The trachea, also known as the windpipe, serves as the passage between the larynx and the bronchi. The pharynx is a tubelike structure that connects the nasal and oral cavities to the larynx. The pharynx also functions as a passage for the respiratory and digestive tracts. The major function of the larynx is vocalization through the function of the vocal cords. The vocal cords are ligaments controlled by muscular movements that produce sound."

        "Choice 1": "Inform that physician that the patient is in a recumbent position and anticipate an order for a portable chest x-ray.",
        "Choice 2": "Turn the patient to enable assessment of all the patient's lung fields.",
        "Choice 3": "Avoid turning the patient, and assess the accessible breath sounds from the anterior chest wall.",
        "Choice 4": "Obtain a pulse oximetry reading, and, if the reading is low, reposition the patient and auscultate breath sounds.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAssessment of the anterior and posterior lung fields is part of the nurse's routine evaluation. If the patient is recumbent, it is essential to turn the patient to assess all lung fields so that dependent areas can be assessed for breath sounds, including the presence of normal breath sounds and adventitious sounds. Failure to examine the dependent areas of the lungs can result in missing significant findings. This makes the other given options unacceptable."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nSputum samples should be submitted to the laboratory as soon as possible. Allowing the specimen to stand for several hours in a warm room results in the overgrowth of contaminated organisms and may make it difficult to identify the pathogenic organisms. Refrigeration of the sputum specimen and the addition of normal saline are not appropriate actions."

        "Choice 1": "A barrel chest",
        "Choice 2": "A funnel chest",
        "Choice 3": "A pigeon chest",
        "Choice 4": "Kyphoscoliosis",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nA funnel chest occurs when there is a depression in the lower portion of the sternum, and this may lead to compression of the heart and great vessels, resulting in murmurs. A barrel chest is characterized by an increase in the anteroposterior diameter of the thorax and is a result of overinflation of the lungs. A pigeon chest occurs as a result of displacement of the sternum and includes an increase in the anteroposterior diameter. Kyphoscoliosis, which is characterized by elevation of the scapula and a corresponding S-shaped spine, limits lung expansion within the thorax."

        "Choice 2": "Pulmonary fibrosis",
        "Choice 3": "Pleural effusion",
        "Choice 4": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nHigh or increased compliance occurs if the lungs have lost their elasticity and the thorax is overdistended, in conditions such as emphysema. Conditions associated with decreased compliance include pneumothorax, hemothorax, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, atelectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, and ARDS."

The nurse notes that the sputum is greenish and that there is a large quantity of it. The nurse notifies the patient's physician because these symptoms are suggestive of what?",
        "Choice 1": "Pneumothorax",
        "Choice 2": "Lung tumors",
        "Choice 3": "Infection",
        "Choice 4": "Pulmonary edema",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe nature of the sputum is often indicative of its cause. A profuse amount of purulent sputum (thick and yellow, green, or rust-colored) or a change in color of the sputum is a common sign of a bacterial infection. Pink-tinged mucoid sputum suggests a lung tumor. Profuse, frothy, pink material, often welling up into the throat, may indicate pulmonary edema. A pneumothorax does not result in copious, green sputum."

        "Choice 4": "Crackles",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nCrackles reflect underlying inflammation or congestion and are often present in such conditions as pneumonia, bronchitis, and congestive heart failure. Rhonchi and wheezes are associated with airway obstruction, which is not a part of the pathophysiology of heart failure."

        "Question": "A patient has a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. The nurse is aware that neuromuscular disorders such as multiple sclerosis may lead to a decreased vital capacity. What does vital capacity measure?",
        "Choice 1": "The volume of air inhaled and exhaled with each breath",
        "Choice 2": "The volume of air in the lungs after a maximal inspiration",
        "Choice 3": "The maximal volume of air inhaled after normal expiration",
        "Choice 4": "The maximal volume of air exhaled from the point of maximal inspiration",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nVital capacity is measured by having the patient take in a maximal breath and exhale fully through a spirometer. Vital lung capacity is the maximal volume of air exhaled from the point of maximal inspiration, and neuromuscular disorders such as multiple sclerosis may lead to a decreased vital capacity. Tidal volume is defined as the volume of air inhaled and exhaled with each breath. The volume of air in the lungs after a maximal inspiration is the total lung capacity. Inspiratory capacity is the maximal volume of air inhaled after normal expiration."

        "Choice 1": "Eupnea",
        "Choice 2": "Apnea",
        "Choice 3": "Biot's respiration",
        "Choice 4": "Cheyne-Stokes",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe nurse will document that the patient is demonstrating a Biot's respiration pattern. Biot's respiration is characterized by periods of normal breathing (three to four breaths) followed by varying periods of apnea (usually 10 seconds to 1 minute). Cheyne-Stokes is a similar respiratory pattern, but it involves a regular cycle where the rate and depth of breathing increase and then decrease until apnea occurs. Biot's respiration is not characterized by the increase and decrease in the rate and depth, as characterized by Cheyne-Stokes. Eupnea is a normal breathing pattern of 12 to 18 breaths per minute. Bradypnea is a slower-than-normal rate (<10 breaths per minute), with normal depth and regular rhythm, and no apnea."

The nurse notes that the patient's voice sounds are distorted and that the letter A is audible instead of the letter E. How should this finding be documented?",
        "Choice 1": "Bronchophony",
        "Choice 2": "Egophony",
        "Choice 3": "Whispered pectoriloquy",
        "Choice 4": "Sonorous wheezes",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThis finding would be documented as egophony, which can be best assessed by instructing the patient to repeat the letter E. The distortion produced by consolidation transforms the sound into a clearly heard A rather than E. Bronchophony describes vocal resonance that is more intense and clearer than normal. Whispered pectoriloquy is a very subtle finding that is heard only in the presence of rather dense consolidation of the lungs. Sound is so enhanced by the consolidated tissue that even whispered words are heard. Sonorous wheezes are not defined as a voice sound, but rather as a breath sound."

        "Choice 1": "“A PFT measures how much air moves in and out of your lungs when you breathe.”",
        "Choice 2": "“A PFT measures how much energy you get from the oxygen you breathe.”",
        "Choice 3": "“A PFT measures how elastic your lungs are.”",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPFTs are routinely used in patients with chronic respiratory disorders. They are performed to assess respiratory function and to determine the extent of dysfunction. Such tests include measurements of lung volumes, ventilatory function, and the mechanics of breathing, diffusion, and gas exchange. Lung elasticity and diffusion can often be implied from PFTs, but they are not directly assessed. Energy obtained from respiration is not measured directly."

        "Choice 4": "Whether or not they are continuous breath sounds",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nNormal breath sounds are distinguished by their location over a specific area of the lung; they are identified as vesicular, bronchovesicular, and bronchial (tubular) breath sounds. Normal breath sounds are heard on both inspiration and expiration, and are continuous. They are not distinguished solely on the basis of volume."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIf the patient uses an alternative method of communication, he will feel in better control and likely be less frustrated. Assuring the patient that everything will be all right offers false reassurance, and telling him not to be upset minimizes his feelings. Neither of these methods helps the patient to communicate. In a patient with an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube, the family members are also likely to encounter difficulty interpreting the patient's wishes. Making them responsible for interpreting the patient's gestures may frustrate the family.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPrevention of oxygen toxicity is achieved by using oxygen only as prescribed. Often, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) or CPAP is used with oxygen therapy to reverse or prevent microatelectasis, thus allowing a lower percentage of oxygen to be used. Oxygen is moistened by passing through a humidification system. Changing the tubing on the oxygen therapy equipment is the best technique for controlling bacterial growth."

        "Choice 2": "Tracheostomy collar",
        "Choice 3": "Venturi mask",
        "Choice 4": "Face tent",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe Venturi mask provides the most accurate method of oxygen delivery. Other methods of oxygen delivery include the aerosol mask, tracheostomy collar, and face tents, but these do not match the precision of a Venturi mask."

        "Question": "The nurse is caring for a patient who is experiencing mild shortness of breath during the immediate postoperative period, with oxygen saturation readings between 89% and 91%. What method of oxygen delivery is most appropriate for the patient's needs?",
        "Choice 1": "Non-rebreathing mask",
        "Choice 2": "Nasal cannula",
        "Choice 3": "Simple mask",
        "Choice 4": "Partial-rebreathing mask",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nA nasal cannula is used when the patient requires a low to medium concentration of oxygen for which precise accuracy is not essential. The Venturi mask is used primarily for patients with COPD because it can accurately provide an appropriate level of supplemental oxygen, thus avoiding the risk of suppressing the hypoxic drive. The patient's respiratory status does not require a partial- or non-rebreathing mask."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nMaintaining a patent (open) airway is achieved through meticulous airway management, whether in an emergency situation such as airway obstruction or in long-term management, as in caring for a patient with an endotracheal or a tracheostomy tube.

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nEndotracheal intubation may be used for no longer than 2 to 3 weeks, by which time a tracheostomy must be considered to decrease irritation of and, trauma to, the tracheal lining, to reduce the incidence of vocal cord paralysis (secondary to laryngeal nerve damage), and to decrease the work of breathing.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nA cotton tampon may be used to try to stop the bleeding. The use of ice on the bridge of the nose has no scientific rationale for care. Laying the client down on the cot could block the client's airway. Hospital admission is necessary only if the bleeding becomes serious."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAntimicrobial agents (antibiotics) should not be used because they do not affect the virus or reduce the incidence of bacterial complications. In addition, their inappropriate use has been implicated in development of organisms resistant to therapy. It would be inappropriate to tell the patient that the physician will not respond to her request."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nA shallow, monotonous respiratory pattern coupled with immobility places the patient at an increased risk of developing atelectasis. These specific factors are less likely to result in pulmonary embolism or aspiration. ARDS involves an exaggerated inflammatory response and does not normally result from factors such as immobility and shallow breathing.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe nurse should encourage hydration because adequate hydration thins and loosens pulmonary secretions. Oral suctioning is not sufficiently deep to remove tracheobronchial secretions. The patient should have the head of the bed raised, and rest should be promoted to avoid exacerbation of symptoms."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe key characteristic of pleuritic pain is its relationship to respiratory movement. Taking a deep breath, coughing, or sneezing worsens the pain. The patient's ABGs would most likely be abnormal and shortness of breath would be expected."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIn the case of a simple pneumothorax, auscultating the breath sounds will reveal absent or diminished breath sounds on the affected side. Paradoxical chest wall movements occur in flail chest conditions. Sudden loss of consciousness does not typically occur. Muffled or distant heart sounds occur in pericardial tamponade."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIf the pneumothorax is large and the lung collapses totally, acute respiratory distress occurs. The patient is anxious, has dyspnea and air hunger, has increased use of the accessory muscles, and may develop central cyanosis from severe hypoxemia. These symptoms are not definitive of pneumothorax, but because of the patient's recent trauma they are inconsistent with anxiety, bronchitis, or aspiration."

        "Choice 4": "Encourage the patient to speak as little as possible",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe key characteristic of pleuritic pain is its relationship to respiratory movement. Taking a deep breath, coughing, or sneezing worsens the pain. A soft diet is not necessarily indicated and there is no need for the patient to avoid speaking. Ambulation has multiple benefits, but pain management is not among them."

        "Choice 1": "Early ambulation",
        "Choice 2": "Increased dietary intake of protein",
        "Choice 3": "Maintaining the patient in a supine position",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nFor patients at risk for PE, the most effective approach for prevention is to prevent deep vein thrombosis. Active leg exercises to avoid venous stasis, early ambulation, and use of elastic compression stocking are general preventive measures. The patient does not require increased dietary intake of protein directly related to prevention of PE, although it will assist in wound healing during the postoperative period. The patient should not be maintained in one position, but frequently repositioned, unless contraindicated by the surgical procedure. Aspirin should never be administered with warfarin because it will increase the patient's risk for bleeding."

        "Choice 1": "“The younger you are when you start smoking, the higher your risk of lung cancer.”",
        "Choice 2": "“The risk for lung cancer never decreases once you have smoked, which is why smokers need annual chest x-rays.”",
        "Choice 3": "“The risk for lung cancer is determined mostly by what type of cigarettes you smoke.”",
        "Choice 4": "“The risk for lung cancer depends primarily on the other risk factors for cancer that you have.”",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nRisk is determined by the pack-year history (number of packs of cigarettes used each day, multiplied by the number of years smoked), the age of initiation of smoking, the depth of inhalation, and the tar and nicotine levels in the cigarettes smoked. The younger a person is when he or she starts smoking, the greater the risk of developing lung cancer. Risk declines after smoking cessation. The type of cigarettes is a significant variable, but this is not the most important factor."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe most frequent symptom of lung cancer is cough or change in a chronic cough. People frequently ignore this symptom and attribute it to smoking or a respiratory infection. A new onset of allergies, frequent respiratory infections and fatigue are not characteristic early signs of lung cancer."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nEarly signs of acute respiratory failure are those associated with impaired oxygenation and may include restlessness, fatigue, headache, dyspnea, air hunger, tachycardia, and increased blood pressure. As the hypoxemia progresses, more obvious signs may be present, including confusion, lethargy, tachycardia, tachypnea, central cyanosis, diaphoresis, and, finally, respiratory arrest. Pneumonia is infectious and would not result from trauma. Pneumoconiosis results from exposure to occupational toxins. A pleural effusion does not cause this constellation of symptoms."

The patient begins complaining of right-sided chest pain that gets worse when he coughs or breathes deeply. Vital signs are within normal limits. What would you suspect this patient is experiencing?",
        "Choice 1": "Traumatic pneumothorax",

        "Choice 4": "Myocardial infarction",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe key characteristic of pleuritic pain is its relationship to respiratory movement. Taking a deep breath, coughing, or sneezing worsens the pain. Pleuritic pain is limited in distribution rather than diffuse; it usually occurs only on one side. The pain may become minimal or absent when the breath is held. It may be localized or radiate to the shoulder or abdomen. Later, as pleural fluid develops, the pain decreases. The scenario does not indicate any trauma to the patient, so a traumatic pneumothorax is implausible. Empyema is unlikely as there is no fever indicative of infection. Myocardial infarction would affect the patient's vital signs profoundly."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe home care nurse should monitor the patient for residual effects of the PE, which involved a severe disruption in respiration and oxygenation. PE has a noninfectious etiology; pneumonia is not impossible, but it is a less likely sequela. Swallowing ability is unlikely to be affected; activity level is important, but secondary to the effects of deoxygenation."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nA host risk factor for COPD is a deficiency of alpha1-antitrypsin, an enzyme inhibitor that protects the lung parenchyma from injury. This deficiency predisposes young patients to rapid development of lobular emphysema even in the absence of smoking. This deficiency does not influence the patient's risk of pulmonary edema, CF, or empyema."

        "Choice 1": "Signs of oxygen toxicity",
        "Choice 2": "Chronic chest pain",
        "Choice 3": "A barrel chest",
        "Choice 4": "Long, thin fingers",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIn COPD patients with a primary emphysematous component, chronic hyperinflation leads to the barrel chest thorax configuration. The nurse most likely would not assess chest pain or long, thin fingers; these are not characteristic of emphysema. The patient would not show signs of oxygen toxicity unless he or she received excess supplementary oxygen."

        "Choice 4": "Trendelenburg",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe typical posture of a person with COPD is to lean forward and use the accessory muscles of respiration to breathe. Low Fowler's positioning would be less likely to aid oxygenation. Prone or Trendelenburg positioning would exacerbate shortness of breath."

        "Choice 4": "Magnesium, thiamine, and iron supplementation",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nNearly 90% of patients with CF have pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and require oral pancreatic enzyme supplementation with meals. Frequent, small meals or TPN are not normally indicated. Vitamin supplements are required, but specific replacement of magnesium, thiamine, and iron is not typical."

        "Choice 4": "Pulmonary function testing",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPostural drainage is part of all treatment plans for bronchiectasis, because draining of the bronchiectatic areas by gravity reduces the amount of secretions and the degree of infection. Diuretics and IV fluids will not aid in the mobilization of secretions. Lung function testing may be indicated, but this assessment will not relieve the patient's symptoms."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe three most common symptoms of asthma are cough, dyspnea, and wheezing. There may be generalized wheezing (the sound of airflow through narrowed airways), first on expiration and then, possibly, during inspiration as well. Respirations are not usually slow and the child's A-P diameter does not normally change."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nEnvironmental risk factors for COPD include prolonged and intense exposure to occupational dusts and chemicals, indoor air pollution, and outdoor air pollution. Smoking cessation should be taught to all patients who are currently smoking. Minor respiratory infections that are of no consequence to the person with normal lungs can produce fatal disturbances in the lungs of the person with emphysema. ADLs should be paced throughout the day to permit patients to perform these without excessive distress."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nCharacteristic symptoms of bronchiectasis include chronic cough and production of purulent sputum in copious amounts. Clubbing of the fingers also is common because of respiratory insufficiency. Sudden pleuritic chest pain is a common manifestation of a pulmonary embolism. Wheezes on auscultation are common in patients with asthma. An increased A-P diameter is noted in patients with COPD."

        "Choice 3": "Use diaphragmatic breathing",
        "Choice 4": "Use chest breathing",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nInspiratory muscle training and breathing retraining may help improve breathing patterns in patients with COPD. Training in diaphragmatic breathing reduces the respiratory rate, increases alveolar ventilation, and, sometimes, helps expel as much air as possible during expiration. Pursed-lip breathing helps slow expiration, prevents collapse of small airways, and controls the rate and depth of respiration. Diaphragmatic breathing, not chest breathing, increases lung expansion. Supine positioning does not aid breathing."

        "Choice 4": "Dry cough",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nClinical manifestations of bronchiectasis include hemoptysis, chronic cough, copious purulent sputum, and clubbing of the fingers. Because of the copious production of sputum, the cough is rarely dry. A pigeon chest is not associated with the disease and patients do not normally experience pain on inspiration."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe hallmark pathology of CF is bronchial mucus plugging, inflammation, and eventual bronchiectasis. Commonly, the bronchiectasis begins in the upper lobes and progresses to involve all lobes. Infection, atelectasis, and COPD are not hallmark pathologies of CF."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nSafe and effective MDI use requires the patient to be able to manipulate the device independently, which may be difficult if the patient has arthritis. Smoking does not preclude MDI use. A modest loss of vision does not preclude the use of an MDI and a patient can safely use more than one MDI."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nCardiac output is computed by multiplying the stroke volume by the heart rate. Cardiac output can be affected by changes in either stroke volume or heart rate, such as a rate of 54 bpm. An increase in preload will lead to an increase in stroke volume. A pulse oximetry reading of 94% does not indicate hypoxemia, as hypoxia can decrease contractility.

        "Question": "The nurse is caring for a patient admitted with angina who is scheduled for cardiac catheterization. The patient is anxious and asks the reason for this test. What is the best response?",
        "Choice 1": "“Cardiac catheterization is usually done to assess how blocked or open a patients coronary arteries are.”",
        "Choice 2": "“Cardiac catheterization is most commonly done to detect how efficiently a patient's heart muscle contracts.”",
        "Choice 3": "“Cardiac catheterization is usually done to evaluate cardiovascular response to stress.”",
        "Choice 4": "“Cardiac catheterization is most commonly done to evaluate cardiac electrical activity.”",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nCardiac catheterization is usually used to assess coronary artery patency to determine if revascularization procedures are necessary. A thallium stress test shows myocardial ischemia after stress. An ECG shows the electrical activity of the heart."

        "Question": "The critical care nurse is caring for a patient who has had an MI. The nurse should expect to assist with establishing what hemodynamic monitoring procedure to assess the patient's left ventricular function?",
        "Choice 1": "Central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring",
        "Choice 2": "Pulmonary artery pressure monitoring (PAPM)",
        "Choice 3": "Systemic arterial pressure monitoring (SAPM)",
        "Choice 4": "Arterial blood gases (ABG)",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPAPM is used to assess left ventricular function. CVP is used to assess right ventricular function; SAPM is used for continual assessment of BP. ABG are used to assess for acidic and alkalotic levels in the blood."

        "Choice 1": "Fluctuations in core body temperature",
        "Choice 2": "Signs and symptoms of esophageal varices",
        "Choice 3": "Signs and symptoms of compartment syndrome",
        "Choice 4": "Perfusion distal to the insertion site",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe radial artery is the usual site selected. However, placement of a catheter into the radial artery can further impede perfusion to an area that has poor circulation. As a result, the tissue distal to the cannulated artery can become ischemic or necrotic. Vigilant assessment is thus necessary. Alterations in temperature and the development of esophageal varices or compartment syndrome are not high risks."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nGauze dressings should be changed every 2 days or transparent dressings at least every 7 days and whenever dressings become damp, loosened, or visibly soiled. Passive ROM exercise is not indicated and it is unnecessary and inappropriate to aspirate blood to test it for pH. Antibiotic ointments are contraindicated."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nDuring the health history, the nurse needs to determine if the patient and involved family members are able to recognize symptoms of an acute cardiac problem, such as acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or HF, and seek timely treatment for these symptoms. Each of the other listed topics is valid, but the timely and appropriate response to a cardiac emergency is paramount."

        "Choice 5": "Independence",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "B,C,D",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThree physiologic characteristics of two types of specialized electrical cells, the nodal cells and the Purkinje cells, provide this synchronization: automaticity, or the ability to initiate an electrical impulse; excitability, or the ability to respond to an electrical impulse; and conductivity, the ability to transmit an electrical impulse from one cell to another. Loop connectivity is a distracter for this question. Independence of the cells has nothing to do with the synchronization described in the scenario."

        "Question": "The nurse is writing a plan of care for a patient with a cardiac dysrhythmia. What would be the most appropriate goal for the patient?",
        "Choice 1": "Maintain a resting heart rate below 70 bpm.",
        "Choice 2": "Maintain adequate control of chest pain.",
        "Choice 3": "Maintain adequate cardiac output.",
        "Choice 4": "Maintain normal cardiac structure.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nFor patient safety, the most appropriate goal is to maintain cardiac output to prevent worsening complications as a result of decreased cardiac output. A resting rate of less than 70 bpm is not appropriate for every patient. Chest pain is more closely associated with acute coronary syndrome than with dysrhythmias. Nursing actions cannot normally influence the physical structure of the heart."

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nBleeding, hematomas, local infections, perforation of the myocardium, and tachycardia are complications of pacemaker implantations. The nurse should monitor for chest pain and bradycardia, but bleeding is a more common immediate complication. Malignant hyperthermia is unlikely because it is a response to anesthesia administration."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAny type of VT in a patient who is unconscious and without a pulse is treated in the same manner as ventricular fibrillation: Immediate defibrillation is the action of choice. ECG monitoring is appropriate, but this is an assessment, not an intervention, and will not resolve the problem. An ICD and angioplasty do not address the dysrhythmia."

        "Choice 4": "Maintain anticoagulation",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nTreatment for atrial fibrillation is to terminate the rhythm or to control ventricular rate. This is a priority because it directly affects cardiac output. A rapid ventricular response reduces the time for ventricular filling, resulting in a smaller stroke volume. Control of rhythm is the initial treatment of choice, followed by anticoagulation with heparin and then Coumadin."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nHigh-output electrical generators can reprogram pacemakers and should be avoided. Recent pacemaker technology allows patients to safely use most household electronic appliances and devices (e.g., microwave ovens). The affected arm should not be raised above the shoulder for 1 week following placement of the pacemaker. Antitheft alarms may be triggered so patients should be taught to walk through them quickly and avoid standing in or near these devices. These alarms generally do not interfere with pacemaker function."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIn external defibrillation, both paddles may be placed on the front of the chest, which is the standard paddle placement. Whether using pads, or paddles, the nurse must observe two safety measures. First, maintain good contact between the pads or paddles and the patient's skin to prevent leaking. Second, ensure that no one is in contact with the patient or with anything that is touching the patient when the defibrillator is discharged, to minimize the chance that electrical current will be conducted to anyone other than the patient.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPatients who are to undergo an EP study may be anxious about the procedure and its outcome. A detailed discussion involving the patient, the family, and the electrophysiologist usually occurs to ensure that the patient can give informed consent and to reduce the patient's anxiety about the procedure. It is inaccurate to state that EP is “risk-free” and stating that it is common does not necessarily relieve the patient's anxiety.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe maze procedure is an open heart surgical procedure for refractory atrial fibrillation. Small transmural incisions are made throughout the atria. The resulting formation of scar tissue prevents reentry conduction of the electrical impulse. Consequently, scar formation would constitute a successful procedure.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nOne major difference between cardioversion and defibrillation is the timing of the delivery of electrical current. In cardioversion, the delivery of the electrical current is synchronized with the patient's electrical events; in defibrillation, the delivery of the current is immediate and unsynchronized. Both can be done on beating heart (i.e., in a dysrhythmia). Cardioversion is not necessarily attempted first."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nWhen the patient experiences lack of oxygen to myocardium cells during an MI, the sooner treatment is initiated, the more likely the treatment will prevent or minimize myocardial tissue necrosis. Delays in treatment equate with increased myocardial damage. Despite the length of time the symptoms have been present, treatment needs to be initiated immediately to minimize further damage.

        "Choice 1": "The symptoms indicate angina and should be treated as such.",
        "Choice 2": "The symptoms indicate a pulmonary etiology rather than a cardiac etiology.",
        "Choice 3": "The symptoms indicate an acute coronary episode and should be treated as such.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nCalcium channel blocking agents decrease sinoatrial node automaticity and atrioventricular node conduction, resulting in a slower heart rate and a decrease in the strength of the heart muscle contraction. These effects decrease the workload of the heart. Antiplatelet and anticoagulation medications are administered to prevent platelet aggregation and subsequent thrombosis, which impedes blood flow. Beta-blockers reduce myocardial consumption by blocking beta-adrenergic sympathetic stimulation to the heart. The result is reduced myocardial contractility (force of contraction) to balance the myocardium oxygen needs and supply. Nitrates reduce myocardial oxygen consumption, which decreases ischemia and relieves pain by dilating the veins and, in higher doses, the arteries."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe desired goal for cholesterol readings is for a patient to have low LDL and high HDL values. LDL exerts a harmful effect on the coronary vasculature because the small LDL particles can be easily transported into the vessel lining. In contrast, HDL promotes the use of total cholesterol by transporting LDL to the liver, where it is excreted. Elevated triglycerides are also a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. A goal is also to keep triglyceride levels less than 150 mg/dL. All individuals possess detectable levels of total cholesterol."

        "Question": "When discussing angina pectoris secondary to atherosclerotic disease with a patient, the patient asks why he tends to experience chest pain when he exerts himself. The nurse should describe which of the following phenomena?",
        "Choice 1": "Exercise increases the heart's oxygen demands.",
        "Choice 2": "Exercise causes vasoconstriction of the coronary arteries.",
        "Choice 3": "Exercise shunts blood flow from the heart to the mesenteric area.",
        "Choice 4": "Exercise increases the metabolism of cardiac medications.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPhysical exertion increases the myocardial oxygen demand. If the patient has arteriosclerosis of the coronary arteries, then blood supply is diminished to the myocardium. Exercise does not cause vasoconstriction or interfere with drug metabolism. Exercise does not shunt blood flow away from the heart."

        "Question": "The nurse is caring for a patient who is believed to have just experienced an MI. The nurse notes changes in the ECG of the patient. What change on an ECG most strongly suggests to the nurse that ischemia is occurring?",
        "Choice 1": "P wave inversion",
        "Choice 2": "T wave inversion",
        "Choice 3": "Q wave changes with no change in ST or T wave",
        "Choice 4": "P wave enlargement",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nT-wave inversion is an indicator of ischemic damage to myocardium. Typically, few changes to P waves occur during or after an MI, whereas Q-wave changes with no change in the ST or T wave indicate an old MI."

        "Question": "An adult patient is admitted to the ED with chest pain. The patient states that he had developed unrelieved chest pain that was present for approximately 20 minutes before coming to the hospital. To minimize cardiac damage, the nurse should expect to administer which of the following interventions?",
        "Choice 1": "Thrombolytics, oxygen administration, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories",
        "Choice 2": "Morphine sulphate, oxygen, and bed rest",
        "Choice 3": "Oxygen and beta-adrenergic blockers",
        "Choice 4": "Bed rest, albuterol nebulizer treatments, and oxygen",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe patient with suspected MI should immediately receive supplemental oxygen, aspirin, nitroglycerin, and morphine. Morphine sulphate reduces preload and decreases workload of the heart, along with increased oxygen from oxygen therapy and bed rest. With decreased cardiac demand, this provides the best chance of decreasing cardiac damage. NSAIDs and beta-blockers are not normally indicated. Albuterol, which is a medication used to manage asthma and respiratory conditions, will increase the heart rate."

The nurse's most recent assessment reveals that the patient's left pedal pulses are not palpable and that the right pedal pulses are rated at +2. What is the nurse's best response?",
        "Choice 1": "Document this expected assessment finding during the initial postoperative period.",
        "Choice 2": "Reposition the patient with his left leg in a dependent position.",
        "Choice 3": "Inform the patient's physician of this assessment finding.",
        "Choice 4": "Administer an ordered dose of subcutaneous heparin.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIf a pulse is absent in any extremity, the cause may be prior catheterization of that extremity, chronic peripheral vascular disease, or a thromboembolic obstruction. The nurse immediately reports newly identified absence of any pulse."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nTo prevent venous thromboembolism, patients should avoid crossing the legs. Activity is generally begun as soon as possible and pillows should not be placed under the popliteal space. Compression stockings are often used to prevent venous thromboembolism, but they would not be applied when symptoms emerge."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe nurse must gather information about the patient's symptoms and activities, especially those that precede and precipitate attacks of angina pectoris. The patient's coping, understanding of the disease, and status following attacks are all important to know, but causative factors are a primary focus of the assessment interview."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAlthough further assessment is warranted, it is not unlikely that the patient is experiencing anxiety. In patients with CAD, this often relates to the threat of sudden death. There is no evidence of confusion (i.e., delirium or dementia) and there may or may not be a spiritual element to her concerns. Similarly, it is not clear that a lack of knowledge or information is the root of her anxiety."

        "Question": "The nurse is caring for patient who tells the nurse that he has an angina attack beginning. What is the nurse's most appropriate initial action?",
        "Choice 1": "Have the patient sit down and put his head between his knees.",
        "Choice 2": "Have the patient perform pursed-lip breathing.",
        "Choice 3": "Have the patient stand still and bend over at the waist.",
        "Choice 4": "Place the patient on bed rest in a semi-Fowler's position.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nWhen a patient experiences angina, the patient is directed to stop all activities and sit or rest in bed in a semi-Fowler's position to reduce the oxygen requirements of the ischemic myocardium. Pursed-lip breathing and standing will not reduce workload to the same extent. No need to have the patient put his head between his legs because cerebral perfusion is not lacking."

        "Choice 3": "Rapid assessment of the patient's peripheral pulses",
        "Choice 4": "Palpation of the patient's cardiac apex",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe 12-lead ECG provides information that assists in ruling out or diagnosing an acute MI. It should be obtained within 10 minutes from the time a patient reports pain or arrives in the ED. Each of the other listed assessments is valid, but ECG monitoring is the most time dependent priority."

Each symptom must be evaluated with regard to time, duration, and the factors that precipitate the symptom and relieve it, and in comparison with previous symptoms. Hypotension and peripheral cyanosis are not typically associated with ACS."

        "Question": "The nurse is creating a plan of care for a patient with acute coronary syndrome. What nursing action should be included in the patient's care plan?",
        "Choice 1": "Facilitate daily arterial blood gas (ABG) sampling.",
        "Choice 2": "Administer supplementary oxygen, as needed.",
        "Choice 3": "Have patient maintain supine positioning when in bed.",
        "Choice 4": "Perform chest physiotherapy, as indicated.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nOxygen should be administered along with medication therapy to assist with symptom relief. Administration of oxygen raises the circulating level of oxygen to reduce pain associated with low levels of myocardial oxygen. Physical rest in bed with the head of the bed elevated or in a supportive chair helps decrease chest discomfort and dyspnea. ABGs are diagnostic, not therapeutic, and they are rarely needed on a daily basis. Chest physiotherapy is not used in the treatment of ACS."

        "Choice 1": "Maximizing cardiac output while minimizing heart rate",
        "Choice 2": "Decreasing energy expenditure of the myocardium",
        "Choice 3": "Balancing myocardial oxygen supply with demand",
        "Choice 4": "Increasing the size of the myocardial muscle",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nBalancing myocardial oxygen supply with demand (e.g., as evidenced by the relief of chest pain) is the top priority in the care of the patient with ACS. Treatment is not aimed directly at minimizing heart rate because some patients experience bradycardia. Increasing the size of the myocardium is never a goal. Reducing the myocardium's energy expenditure is often beneficial, but this must be balanced with productivity."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAlleviating anxiety and decreasing fear are important nursing functions that reduce the sympathetic stress response. Referrals to spiritual care may or may not be appropriate, and this does not relieve the nurse of responsibility for addressing the patient's psychosocial needs. Treatment is not always successful, and false hope should never be fostered. Participation in rehabilitation may alleviate anxiety for some patients, but it may exacerbate it for others."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPTCA is used to open blocked coronary vessels and resolve ischemia. The procedure may result in beneficial changes to the patient's LOC or heart rate, but these are not the overarching goals of PTCA. Increased arterial flow is the focus of the procedures."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nMost patients remain intubated and on mechanical ventilation for several hours after surgery. It is important that patients realize that this will prevent them from talking, and the nurse should reassure them that the staff will be able to assist them with other means of communication. Teaching would generally not include symptoms of low blood pressure or hypovolemia, as these are not applicable to most patients.

        "Question": "The critical care nurse is caring for a patient who is receiving cyclosporine postoperative heart transplant. The patient asks the nurse to remind him what this medication is for. How should the nurse best respond?",
        "Choice 1": "Azathioprine decreases the risk of thrombus formation.",
        "Choice 2": "Azathioprine ensures adequate cardiac output.",
        "Choice 3": "Azathioprine increases the number of white blood cells.",
        "Choice 4": "Azathioprine minimizes rejection of the transplant.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAfter heart transplant, patients are constantly balancing the risk of rejection with the risk of infection. Most commonly, patients receive cyclosporine or tacrolimus (FK506, Prograf), azathioprine (Imuran), or mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept), and corticosteroids (prednisone) to minimize rejection. Cyclosporine does not prevent thrombus formation, enhance cardiac output, or increase white cell counts."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAlthough rare, bacterial endocarditis may be life-threatening. A key strategy is primary prevention in high-risk patients (i.e., those with rheumatic heart disease, mitral valve prolapse, or prosthetic heart valves). Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for high-risk patients immediately before and sometimes after certain procedures. Amoxicillin is the drug of choice. None of the other listed drugs is an antibiotic."

        "Choice 1": "Anxiety related to pericarditis",
        "Choice 2": "Acute pain related to pericarditis",
        "Choice 3": "Ineffective tissue perfusion related to pericarditis",
        "Choice 4": "Ineffective breathing pattern related to pericarditis",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe most characteristic symptom of pericarditis is chest pain, although pain also may be located beneath the clavicle, in the neck, or in the left trapezius (scapula) region. The pain or discomfort usually remains fairly constant, but it may worsen with deep inspiration and when lying down or turning. Anxiety is highly plausible and should be addressed, but chest pain is a nearly certain accompaniment to the disease. Breathing and tissue perfusion are likely to be at risk, but pain is certain, especially in the early stages of treatment."

        "Question": "A patient newly admitted to the telemetry unit is experiencing progressive fatigue, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. Diagnostic testing has revealed that these signs and symptoms are attributable to pulmonary venous hypertension. What valvular disorder should the nurse anticipate being diagnosed in this patient?",
        "Choice 1": "Aortic regurgitation",
        "Choice 2": "Mitral stenosis",
        "Choice 3": "Mitral valve prolapse",
        "Choice 4": "Aortic stenosis",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe first symptom of mitral stenosis is often dyspnea on exertion as a result of pulmonary venous hypertension. Symptoms usually develop after the valve opening is reduced by one-third to one-half its usual size. Patients are likely to show progressive fatigue as a result of low cardiac output. The enlarged left atrium may create pressure on the left bronchial tree, resulting in a dry cough or wheezing. Patients may expectorate blood (i.e., hemoptysis) or experience palpitations, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND), and repeated respiratory infections. Pulmonary venous hypertension is not typically caused by aortic regurgitation, mitral valve prolapse, or aortic stenosis."

The patient tells the nurse that he is unsure why the surgeon did not opt to replace his damaged valve rather than repairing it. What is an advantage of valvuloplasty that the nurse should cite?",
        "Choice 1": "The procedure can be performed on an outpatient basis in a physician's office.",
        "Choice 2": "Repaired valves tend to function longer than replaced valves.",
        "Choice 3": "The procedure is not associated with a risk for infection.",
        "Choice 4": "Lower doses of antirejection drugs are required than with valve replacement.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIn general, valves that undergo valvuloplasty function longer than prosthetic valve replacements and patients do not require continuous anticoagulation. Valvuloplasty carries a risk of infection, like all surgical procedures, and it is not performed in a physician's office. Antirejection drugs are unnecessary because foreign tissue is not introduced."

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nTo help determine the causative organisms and the most effective antibiotic treatment for the patient, blood cultures are taken. A CBC can help establish the degree and stage of infection, but not the causative microorganism. Echocardiography cannot indicate the microorganisms causing the infection. “Cardiac aspiration” is not a diagnostic test."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nGroup A streptococcus can cause rheumatic heart fever, resulting in rheumatic endocarditis. Being aware of signs and symptoms of streptococcal infections, identifying them quickly, and treating them promptly, are the best preventative techniques for rheumatic endocarditis. Smoking cessation, immunizations, and calcium channel blockers will not prevent rheumatic heart disease."

        "Choice 1": "Cardiac catheterization",
        "Choice 2": "Arterial blood gases",
        "Choice 3": "Echocardiogram",
        "Choice 4": "Exercise stress test",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe echocardiogram is one of the most helpful diagnostic tools because the structure and function of the ventricles can be observed easily. The ECG is also important, and can demonstrate dysrhythmias and changes consistent with left ventricular hypertrophy. Cardiac catheterization specifically addresses coronary artery function and arterial blood gases evaluate gas exchange and acid balance. Stress testing is not normally used to differentiate cardiomyopathy from other cardiac pathologies."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nOrthotopic transplantation is the most common surgical procedure for cardiac transplantation. The recipient's heart is removed, and the donor heart is implanted at the vena cava and pulmonary veins. Some surgeons still prefer to remove the recipient's heart, leaving a portion of the recipient's atria (with the vena cava and pulmonary veins) in place. Homografts, or allografts (i.e., human valves), are obtained from cadaver tissue donations and are used for aortic and pulmonic valve replacement. Xenografts and heterotropic transplantation are not terms used to describe heart transplantation."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAortic regurgitation eventually causes left ventricular hypertrophy. In aortic regurgitation, blood from the aorta returns to the left ventricle during diastole in addition to the blood normally delivered by the left atrium. The left ventricle dilates, trying to accommodate the increased volume of blood. Aortic regurgitation does not cause cardiac tamponade, right-sided heart failure, or ventricular insufficiency."

Regardless of the category and cause, cardiomyopathy may lead to severe heart failure, lethal dysrhythmias, and death. The pathophysiology of all cardiomyopathies is a series of progressive events that culminate in impaired cardiac output.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAortic regurgitation occurs when the aortic valve does not completely close, and blood flows back to the left ventricle from the aorta during diastole. Aortic regurgitation does not cause obstruction of blood flow from the left ventricle, blood to flow back from the left atrium to the left ventricle, or obstruction of blood from the left atrium to left ventricle."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nCardiogenic shock may occur following an MI when a large area of the myocardium becomes ischemic, necrotic, and hypokinetic. It also can occur as a result of end-stage heart failure, cardiac tamponade, pulmonary embolism, cardiomyopathy, and dysrhythmias. While patients with acute renal failure are at risk for dysrhythmias and patients experiencing a stroke are at risk for thrombus formation, the patient admitted following an MI is at the greatest risk for development of cardiogenic shock when compared with the other listed diagnoses."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nSystolic blood pressure that is markedly lower during inhalation is called pulsus paradoxus. The difference in systolic pressure between the point that is heard during exhalation and the point that is heard during inhalation is measured. Pulsus paradoxus exceeding 10 mm Hg is abnormal."

In providing cardiac resuscitation documentation, how will the nurse describe this initial absence of cardiac rhythm?",
        "Choice 1": "Pulseless electrical activity (PEA)",
        "Choice 2": "Ventricular fibrillation",

        "Choice 4": "Asystole",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nCardiac arrest occurs when the heart ceases to produce an effective pulse and circulate blood. It may be caused by a cardiac electrical event such as ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, profound bradycardia, or when there is no heart rhythm at all (asystole). Cardiac arrest may also occur when electrical activity is present, but there is ineffective cardiac contraction or circulating volume, which is PEA. Asystole is the only condition that involves the absolute absence of a heart rhythm."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nOrthopnea is defined as difficulty breathing while lying flat. This is a possible complication of HF and, consequently, the nurse should avoid positioning the patient supine. Oxygen supplementation may or may not be necessary and activity does not always need to be curtailed. Deep breathing and coughing exercises do not directly address this symptom."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAn important nursing role during titration is educating the patient about the potential worsening of symptoms during the early phase of treatment and stressing that improvement may take several weeks. Relief does not take 4 months, however. The nurse monitors blood pressure, but changes are not made based on short-term assessment results. Beta-blockers rarely affect LOC."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe heart is auscultated for an S3 heart sound, a sign that the heart is beginning to fail and that increased blood volume fills the ventricle with each beat. HF does not normally cause a pleural friction rub or murmurs. Changes in breath sounds occur, such as the emergence of crackles or wheezes, but faint breath sounds are less characteristic of HF."

When planning this patient's subsequent care, what nursing diagnosis should be identified?",
        "Choice 1": "Risk for ineffective tissue perfusion related to dysrhythmia",

        "Choice 4": "Risk for falls related to hypotension",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe combination of low BP, diuretic use, and ACE inhibitor use constitute a risk for falls. There is no evidence, or heightened risk, of dysrhythmia. The patient's medications create a risk for fluid deficit, not fluid excess. Hypoxia is a risk for all patients with HF, but this is not in evidence for this patient at this time."

        "Choice 1": "HF ultimately affects oxygen transportation to the brain.",
        "Choice 2": "Patients with HF are susceptible to overstimulation of the sympathetic nervous system.",
        "Choice 3": "Decreased LOC causes an exacerbation of the signs and symptoms of HF.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAs the volume of blood ejected by the heart decreases, so does the amount of oxygen transported to the brain. Sympathetic stimulation is not a primary concern in patients with HF, although it is a possibility. HF affects LOC but the reverse is not usually true. Medications used to treat HF carry many adverse effects, but the most common and significant effects are cardiovascular."

The risk of respiratory depression is not the intent of the action of pain control. Respiratory depression should not be used as an excuse to withhold pain medication for a terminally ill patient. The patient's respiratory status should be carefully monitored and any changes should be reported to the physician."

        "Question": "An audit of a large, university medical center reveals that four patients in the hospital have current orders for restraints. You know that restraints are an intervention of last resort, and that it is inappropriate to apply restraints to which of the following patients?",
        "Choice 1": "A postlaryngectomy patient who is attempting to pull out his tracheostomy tube",
        "Choice 2": "A patient in hypovolemic shock trying to remove the dressing over his central venous catheter",
        "Choice 3": "A patient with urosepsis who is ringing the call bell incessantly to use the bedside commode",
        "Choice 4": "A patient with depression who has just tried to commit suicide and whose medications are not achieving adequate symptom control",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nRestraints should never be applied for staff convenience. The patient with urosepsis who is frequently ringing the call bell is requesting assistance to the bedside commode; this is appropriate behavior that will not result in patient harm. The other described situations could plausibly result in patient harm; therefore, it is more likely appropriate to apply restraints in these instances."

        "Choice 2": "Confidentiality",
        "Choice 3": "Autonomy",
        "Choice 4": "Justice",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAutonomy entails the ability to make a choice free from external constraints. Beneficence is the duty to do good and the active promotion of benevolent acts. Confidentiality relates to the concept of privacy. Justice states that cases should be treated equitably."

        "Question": "A patient with migraines does not know whether she is receiving a placebo for pain management or the new drug that is undergoing clinical trials. Upon discussing the patient's distress, it becomes evident to the nurse that the patient did not fully understand the informed consent document that she signed. Which ethical principle is most likely involved in this situation?",
        "Choice 1": "Sanctity of life",
        "Choice 2": "Confidentiality",
        "Choice 3": "Veracity",
        "Choice 4": "Fidelity",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nTelling the truth (veracity) is one of the basic principles of our culture. Three ethical dilemmas in clinical practice that can directly conflict with this principle are the use of placebos (nonactive substances used for treatment), not revealing a diagnosis to a patient, and revealing a diagnosis to persons other than the patient with the diagnosis. All involve the issue of trust, which is an essential element in the nurse–patient relationship. Sanctity of life is the perspective that life is the highest good. Confidentiality deals with privacy of the patient. Fidelity is promise-keeping and the duty to be faithful to one's commitments."

        "Choice 4": "Examine and analyze all available information.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nCritical thinking involves reasoning and purposeful, systematic, reflective, rational, outcome-directed thinking based on a body of knowledge, as well as examination and analysis of all available information and ideas. A full disregard of one's own experiences is not possible. Critical thinking does not denote a focus on potential negative outcomes. Input from others is a valuable resource that should not be ignored."

        "Choice 3": "An ability to base decisions on what has happened in the past",
        "Choice 4": "Openness to various viewpoints",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nWillingness and openness to various viewpoints are inherent in critical thinking; these allow the nurse to reflect on the current situation. An emphasis on the past, willingness to observe behaviors, and a desire to utilize the nursing scope of practice fully are not central characteristics of critical thinkers."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIndependent judgments and decisions evolve from a sound knowledge base and the ability to synthesize information within the context in which it is presented. Critical thinking enhances clinical decision making, helping to identify patient needs and the best nursing actions that will assist patients in meeting those needs. Critical thinking does not normally focus on identify patient desires; these would be identified by asking the patient."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",

Leg exercises and early ambulation are among the interventions that address this risk. Assessment of peripheral circulation is important, but Doppler ultrasound may not be necessary to obtain these data. Dependent positioning increases the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE).

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nMeasures taken to prevent complications include avoiding tight-fitting socks and panty girdles; maintaining activities, such as walking, sleeping with legs elevated, and using pressure stockings. Not included in the teaching plan for venous insufficiency would be reducing activity, sleeping with legs dependent, and avoiding pressure stockings. Each of these actions exacerbates venous insufficiency."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nWound healing is highly dependent on adequate nutrition. The diet should be sufficiently high in calories and protein. Antibiotic ointments are not normally used on the skin surrounding a leg ulcer and occlusive dressings can exacerbate impaired blood flow. Hydrogen peroxide is not normally used because it can damage granulation tissue."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nLymphedema, which is caused by accumulation of lymph in the tissues, constitutes a significant risk for infection. The patient's body image is likely to be disturbed, and the nurse should address this, but infection is a more significant threat to the patient's physiological well-being. Lymphedema is unrelated to ineffective health maintenance and deficient fluid volume is not a significant risk."

        "Choice 1": "Sit with crossed legs for a few minutes each hour to promote relaxation.",
        "Choice 2": "Walk for several minutes every hour to promote circulation.",
        "Choice 3": "Elevate the legs when tired.",
        "Choice 4": "Wear snug-fitting ankle socks to decrease edema.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nA proactive approach to preventing varicose veins would be to walk for several minutes every hour to promote circulation. Sitting with crossed legs may promote relaxation, but it is contraindicated for patients with, or at risk for, varicose veins. Elevating the legs only helps blood passively return to the heart and does not help maintain the competency of the valves in the veins. Wearing tight ankle socks is contraindicated for patients with, or at risk for, varicose veins; socks that are below the muscles of the calf do not promote venous return, the socks simply capture the blood and promote venous stasis."

        "Choice 1": "Cellulitis",
        "Choice 2": "Local inflammation",
        "Choice 3": "Elephantiasis",
        "Choice 4": "Lymphangitis",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nLymphangitis is an acute inflammation of the lymphatic channels. It arises most commonly from a focus of infection in an extremity. Usually, the infectious organism is hemolytic streptococcus. The characteristic red streaks that extend up the arm or the leg from an infected wound outline the course of the lymphatic vessels as they drain. Cellulitis is caused by bacteria, which cause a generalized edema in the subcutaneous tissues surrounding the affected area. Local inflammation would not present with red streaks in the lymphatic channels. Elephantiasis is transmitted by mosquitoes that carry parasitic worm larvae; the parasites obstruct the lymphatic channels and results in gross enlargement of the limbs."

The patient's pain became much worse last night and appeared along with fever, chills, and sweating. The patient states, “I hit my leg on the car door 4 or 5 days ago and it has been sore ever since.” The patient has a history of chronic venous insufficiency. What intervention should the nurse anticipate for this patient?",
        "Choice 1": "Platelet transfusion to treat thrombocytopenia",

The signs and symptoms include acute onset of swelling, localized redness, and pain; it is frequently associated with systemic signs of fever, chills, and sweating. The patient may be able to identify a trauma that accounts for the source of infection. Thrombocytopenia is a loss or decrease in platelets and increases a patient's risk of bleeding; this problem would not cause these symptoms. Arterial insufficiency would present with ongoing pain related to activity. This patient does not have signs and symptoms of VTE."

In this woman's case, she has venous stasis from immobility, vessel wall injury from PAD, and altered blood coagulation from HF. The cause of aoritis is unknown, but it has no direct connection to HF, PAD, or mobility issues. The greatest risk factors for thoracic aortic aneurysm are atherosclerosis and hypertension; there is no direct connection to HF, PAD, or mobility issues. Raynaud's disease is a disorder that involves spasms of blood vessels and, again, no direct connection to HF, PAD, or mobility issues."

While providing his health history, the patient reveals that he smokes about two packs of cigarettes a day, has a history of alcohol abuse, and does not exercise. What would be the priority health education for this patient?",
        "Choice 1": "The lack of exercise, which is the main cause of PAD.",
        "Choice 2": "The likelihood that heavy alcohol intake is a significant risk factor for PAD.",

One of the nursing diagnoses in the care plan is altered peripheral tissue perfusion related to compromised circulation. What is the most appropriate intervention for this diagnosis?",
        "Choice 1": "Elevate his legs and arms above his heart when resting.",
        "Choice 2": "Encourage the patient to engage in a moderate amount of exercise.",

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe nursing diagnosis of altered peripheral tissue perfusion related to compromised circulation requires interventions that focus on improving circulation. Encouraging the patient to engage in a moderate amount of exercise serves to improve circulation. Elevating his legs and arms above his heart when resting would be passive and fails to promote circulation. Encouraging long periods of sitting or standing would further compromise circulation. The nurse should encourage, not discourage, walking to increase circulation and decrease pain."

The patient has been walking on a regular basis for about a week and walks for 15 minutes 3 times a day. The patient states that he is having a cramp-like pain in the legs every time he walks and that the pain gets “better when I rest.” The patient's care plan should address what problem?",
        "Choice 1": "Decreased mobility related to VTE",
        "Choice 2": "Acute pain related to intermittent claudication",
        "Choice 3": "Decreased mobility related to venous insufficiency",
        "Choice 4": "Acute pain related to vasculitis",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIntermittent claudication presents as a muscular, cramp-type pain in the extremities consistently reproduced with the same degree of exercise or activity and relieved by rest. Patients with peripheral arterial insufficiency often complain of intermittent claudication due to a lack of oxygen to muscle tissue. Venous insufficiency presents as a disorder of venous blood reflux and does not present with cramp-type pain with exercise. Vasculitis is an inflammation of the blood vessels and presents with weakness, fever, and fatigue, but does not present with cramp-type pain with exercise. The pain associated with VTE does not have this clinical presentation."

The nurse's plan of care calls for the patient to walk for 10 minutes 3 times a day. The patient questions the relationship between walking and heart function. How should the nurse best reply?",
        "Choice 1": "“The arteries in your legs constrict when you walk and allow the blood to move faster and with more pressure on the tissue.”",
        "Choice 2": "Walking increases your heart rate and blood pressure. Therefore your heart is under less stress.”",
        "Choice 3": "“Walking helps your heart adjust to your new arteries and helps build your self-esteem.”",
        "Choice 4": "“When you walk, the muscles in your legs contract and pump the blood in your veins back toward your heart, which allows more blood to return to your heart.”",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nVeins, unlike arteries, are equipped with valves that allow blood to move against the force of gravity. The legs have one-way bicuspid valves that prevent blood from seeping backward as it moves forward by the muscles in our legs pressing on the veins as we walk and increasing venous return. Leg arteries do constrict when walking, which allows the blood to move faster and with more pressure on the tissue, but the greater concern is increasing the flow of venous blood to the heart. Walking increases, not decreases, the heart' pumping ability, which increases heart rate and blood pressure and the hearts ability to manage stress. Walking does help the heart adjust to new arteries and may enhance self-esteem, but the patient had an MI—there are no “new arteries.”"

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nVenous ulcerations in the area of the medial or lateral malleolus (gaiter area) are typically large, superficial, and highly exudative. Venous hypertension causes extravasation of blood, which discolors the area of the wound bed. Bleeding is not normally present."

        "Choice 2": "Prothrombin time (PT) eight to ten times the control",
        "Choice 3": "International normalized ratio (INR) between 2 and 3",
        "Choice 4": "Hematocrit of 32%",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe INR is most often used to determine if warfarin is at a therapeutic level; an INR of 2 to 3 is considered therapeutic. Warfarin is also considered to be at therapeutic levels when the client's PT is 1.5 to 2 times the control. Higher values indicate increased risk of bleeding and hemorrhage, whereas lower values indicate increased risk of blood clot formation. Heparin, not warfarin, prolongs PTT. Hematocrit does not provide information on the effectiveness of warfarin; however, a falling hematocrit in a client taking warfarin may be a sign of hemorrhage."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe patient with peripheral vascular disease or diabetes should receive education or reinforcement about skin and foot care. Intermittent claudication and other chronic peripheral vascular diseases reduce oxygenation to the feet, making them susceptible to injury and poor healing; therefore, meticulous foot care is essential. The patient should stop smoking—not just cut down—because nicotine is a vasoconstrictor. Daily walking benefits the patient with intermittent claudication. Increased protein intake will not alleviate the patient's symptoms."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPositioning of the legs depends on whether the ulcer is of arterial or venous origin.

Blood pressures are extremely elevated in both urgency and emergencies, but there is no evidence of target organ damage in hypertensive urgency. Extremely close hemodynamic monitoring of the patient's BP is required in both situations. The medications of choice in hypertensive emergencies are those with an immediate effect, such as IV vasodilators.

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nBlood pressures should be taken with the patient seated with arm bare, supported, and at heart level. The patient should not have smoked tobacco or taken caffeine in the 30 minutes preceding the measurement. The patient should rest quietly for 5 minutes before the reading is taken. The cuff bladder should encircle at least 80% of the limb being measured and have a width of at least 40% of limb circumference. Using a cuff that is too large results in a lower BP and a cuff that is too small will give a higher BP measurement."

        "Choice 1": "Ensure that the patient receives a larger initial dose of antihypertensive medication due to impaired absorption.",
        "Choice 2": "Pay close attention to hydration status because of increased sensitivity to extracellular volume depletion.",
        "Choice 3": "Recognize that an older adult is less likely to adhere to his or her medication regimen than a younger patient.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nElderly people have impaired cardiovascular reflexes and thus are more sensitive to extracellular volume depletion caused by diuretics. The nurse needs to assess hydration status, low BP, and postural hypotension carefully. Older adults may have impaired absorption, but they do not need a higher initial dose of an antihypertensive than a younger person. Adherence to treatment is not necessarily linked to age. Kidney function and absorption decline with age; less, rather than more antihypertensive medication is prescribed.  Weight gain is not necessarily indicative of kidney function decline."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nVitamin B12 and folic acid deficiencies are characterized by the production of abnormally large erythrocytes called megaloblasts. Because these cells are abnormal, many are sequestered (trapped) while still in the bone marrow, and their rate of release is decreased. Some of these cells actually die in the marrow before they can be released into the circulation. This results in megaloblastic anemia. This pathologic process does not involve inadequate production, premature release, or injury to existing RBCs."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe substance plasminogen is required to lyse (break down) the fibrin. Plasminogen, which is present in all body fluids, circulates with fibrinogen and is therefore incorporated into the fibrin clot as it forms. When the clot is no longer needed (e.g., after an injured blood vessel has healed), the plasminogen is activated to form plasmin. Plasmin digests the fibrinogen and fibrin. Prothrombin is converted to thrombin, which in turn catalyzes the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin so a clot can form."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nA donor who appears pale or complains of faintness should immediately lie down or sit with the head lowered below the knees. He or she should be observed for another 30 minutes. There is no immediate need for a physician's care. Supplementary oxygen may be beneficial, but may take too much time to facilitate before a syncopal episode. Repositioning must precede assessment of vital signs."

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAn acute hemolytic reaction occurs when the donor blood is incompatible with that of the recipient. In the case of a febrile nonhemolytic reaction, antibodies to donor leukocytes remain in the unit of blood or blood component. An allergic reaction is a sensitivity reaction to a plasma protein within the blood component. Hypervolemia does not cause an acute hemolytic reaction."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe most common causes of acute hemolytic reaction are errors in blood component labeling and patient identification that result in the administration of an ABO-incompatible transfusion. Actions to address these causes are necessary in all health care settings. Prophylactic antihistamines are not normally administered, and would not prevent acute hemolytic reactions.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe patient is showing early signs of hypervolemia; the nurse should slow the infusion rate and assess the patient closely for any signs of exacerbation. At this stage, discontinuing the transfusion is not necessary. A bolus would worsen the patient's fluid overload."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe nurse should infuse each unit of platelets as fast as patient can tolerate to diminish platelet clumping during administration. IV access should be established prior to obtaining the platelets from the blood bank. A central line is appropriate for administration, but peripheral IV access (22-gauge or larger) is sufficient.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIn hemolytic anemias, premature destruction of erythrocytes results in the liberation of hemoglobin from the erythrocytes into the plasma; the released hemoglobin is converted in large part to bilirubin, and therefore the bilirubin concentration rises. The increased erythrocyte destruction leads to tissue hypoxia, which in turn stimulates erythropoietin production.

        "Choice 2": "Vitamin K",
        "Choice 3": "Oral anticoagulants",
        "Choice 4": "Heparin infusion",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPatients with liver dysfunction may have life-threatening hemorrhage from peptic ulcers or esophageal varices. In these cases, replacement with fresh frozen plasma, PRBCs, and platelets is usually required. Vitamin K may be ordered once the bleeding is stopped, but that is not what is needed to stop the bleeding of the varices. Anticoagulants would exacerbate the patient's bleeding."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nDespite extremely low platelet counts, platelet transfusions are usually avoided. Transfusions tend to be ineffective not because the platelets are nonfunctional but because the patient's antiplatelet antibodies bind with the transfused platelets, causing them to be destroyed. Matching the patient's blood type is not usually necessary for a platelet transfusion. Platelet transfusions do not exacerbate low platelet production."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAcquired immunity usually develops as a result of prior exposure to an antigen, often through immunization. When the body is attacked by bacteria, viruses, or other pathogens, it has three means of defense.  The first line of defense, the phagocytic immune response, involves the WBCs that have the ability to ingest foreign particles. A second protective response is the humoral immune response, which begins when the B lymphocytes transform themselves into plasma cells that manufacture antibodies.

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nMonocytes migrate to injury sites and function as phagocytic cells, engulfing, ingesting, and destroying greater numbers and quantities of foreign bodies or toxins than granulocytes.  This occurs in response to the foreign bodies that have invaded the laceration from the dirt on the broken glass.  Interferon, one type of biologic response modifier, is a nonspecific viricidal protein that is naturally produced by the body and is capable of activating other components of the immune system.  Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is the body's way of destroying worn out cells such as blood or skin cells or cells that need to be renewed.  Cytokines are the various proteins that mediate the immune response. These do not migrate to injury sites."

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe recognition stage of antigens as foreign by the immune system is the initiating event in any immune response.  The body must first recognize invaders as foreign before it can react to them.  In the proliferation stage, the circulating lymphocyte containing the antigenic message returns to the nearest lymph node.  Once in the node, the sensitized lymphocyte stimulates some of the resident dormant T and B lymphocytes to enlarge, divide, and proliferate.  In the response stage, the differentiated lymphocytes function either in a humoral or a cellular capacity.  In the effector stage, either the antibody of the humoral response or the cytotoxic (killer) T cell of the cellular response reaches and connects with the antigen on the surface of the foreign invader."

        "Question": "A nurse is planning a patient's care and is relating it to normal immune response. During what stage of the immune response should the nurse know that antibodies or cytotoxic T cells combine and destroy the invading microbes?",
        "Choice 1": "Recognition stage",
        "Choice 2": "Proliferation stage",
        "Choice 3": "Response stage",
        "Choice 4": "Effector stage",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIn the effector stage, either the antibody of the humoral response or the cytotoxic (killer) T cell of the cellular response reaches and couples with the antigen on the surface of the foreign invader. The coupling initiates a series of events that in most instances results in total destruction of the invading microbes or the complete neutralization of the toxin. This does not take place during the three preceding stages."

        "Choice 3": "Proteins",
        "Choice 4": "Complex carbohydrates",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nDepletion of protein reserves results in atrophy of lymphoid tissues, depression of antibody response, reduction in the number of circulating T cells, and impaired phagocytic function. As a result, the patient has an increased susceptibility to infection. Low intake of fat and vitamin B12 affects health, but is not noted to directly create a risk for infection. Low intake of complex carbohydrates is not noted to constitute a direct risk factor for infection."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nMost immune responses to antigens involve both humoral and cellular responses, although only one predominates.  For example, during transplantation rejection, the cellular response predominates, whereas in the bacterial pneumonias and sepsis, the humoral response plays the dominant role.  Neither mitigated nor nonspecific cell response is noted in this situation."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nDuring the first mechanism of defense, white blood cells, which have the ability to ingest foreign particles, move to the point of attack, where they engulf and destroy the invading agents. This is known as phagocytosis. The action described is not apoptosis (programmed cell death) or an antibody response. Phagocytosis occurs in the context of the cellular immune response, but it does not constitute the entire cellular response."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nChemotherapy affects bone marrow function, destroying cells that contribute to an effective immune response and resulting in immunosuppression. Antibiotics in large doses cause bone marrow suppression, but antineoplastic drugs have the most pronounced immunosuppressive effect. NSAIDs and antiretrovirals do not normally have this effect."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPrimary immune deficiency results from improper development of immune cells or tissues. These disorders are usually congenital or inherited. Autoimmune disorders are less likely to have a genetic component, though some have a genetic component. Overproduction of immunoglobulins is the hallmark of gammopathies. Rheumatic disorders do not normally involve impaired immune function."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nApoptosis, or programmed cell death, is the body's way of destroying worn out cells such as blood or skin cells or cells that need to be renewed.  Opsonization is the coating of antigen–antibody molecules with a sticky substance to facilitate phagocytosis. The body does not use phagocytosis or the cellular immune response to remove cells from circulation."

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIn the response stage, the differentiated lymphocytes function in either a humoral or a cellular capacity. In the effector stage, either the antibody of the humoral response or the cytotoxic (killer) T cell of the cellular response reaches and connects with the antigen on the surface of the foreign invader. In the recognition stage, the recognition of antigens as foreign, or non-self, by the immune system is the initiating event in any immune response.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nComplement has three major physiologic functions: defending the body against bacterial infection, bridging natural and acquired immunity, and disposing of immune complexes and the byproducts associated with inflammation. Complement does not mark the parameters of the immune response; complement does not collect immune complexes during inflammation."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nT cells interact closely with B cells, indicating that humoral and cellular immune responses are not separate, unrelated processes, but rather branches of the immune response that interact. Movement of B cells does not clearly show the presence of a unified immune system. The differentiation between types of T cells and the role of the complement system do not directly suggest a single immune system."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAlthough prophylactic drug treatment effectively prevents some bacterial and fungal infections, it must be used with caution because it has been implicated in the emergence of resistant organisms. Use of antibiotics does not directly increase the risk of viral infections."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nInfants with X-linked agammaglobulinemia usually become symptomatic after the natural loss of maternally transmitted immunoglobulins (passive acquired immunity), which occurs at about 5 to 6 months of age. Opsonization is the coating of antigen–antibody molecules with a sticky substance to facilitate phagocytosis.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIn prioritizing care, the pneumonia would be assessed first by the nurse.  Tachypnea and restlessness are symptoms of altered respiratory status and need immediate priority. Weight loss of 1 pound is probably fluid related; frequent loose stools would not take short-term precedence over a temperature or tachypnea and restlessness. An oral temperature of 100°F is not considered a fever and would not be the first issue addressed."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAdministering antidiarrheal agents on a regular schedule may be more beneficial than administering them on an as-needed basis, provided the patient's diarrhea is not caused by an infectious microorganism. Increased oral fluid may exacerbate diarrhea; IV fluid replacement is often indicated. Small, more frequent meals may be beneficial, and it is unrealistic to increase activity while the patient has frequent diarrhea."

        "Question": "A patient is learning about his new diagnosis of asthma with the asthma nurse.  What medication has the ability to prevent the onset of acute asthma exacerbations?",
        "Choice 1": "Diphenhydramine (Benadryl)",
        "Choice 2": "Montelukast (Singulair)",
        "Choice 3": "Albuterol sulfate (Ventolin)",
        "Choice 4": "Epinephrine",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nMany manifestations of inflammation can be attributed in part to leukotrienes.  Medications categorized as leukotriene antagonists or modifiers such as montelukast (Singulair) block the synthesis or action of leukotrienes and prevent signs and symptoms associated with asthma. Diphenhydramine prevents histamine's effect on smooth muscle.  Albuterol sulfate relaxes smooth muscle during an asthma attack.  Epinephrine relaxes bronchial smooth muscle but is not used on a preventative basis."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nType II reactions, or cytotoxic hypersensitivity, occur when the system mistakenly identifies a normal constituent of the body as foreign. An example of this type of reaction is Goodpasture syndrome. Type III, or immune complex, hypersensitivity involves immune complexes that are formed when antigens bind to antibodies. Type IV hypersensitivity is mediated by sensitized T cells that cause cell and tissue damage. Histamine does not directly cause cell lysis."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nVariables that appear to influence the degree of adherence to a prescribed therapeutic regimen include gender, race, education, illness, complexity of the regimen, and the cost of treatments. The ethnic background of the health care provider and the personality of the physician are not considered variables that appear to influence the degree of adherence to a prescribed therapeutic regimen. A learning disability could greatly affect adherence, but cost is a more likely barrier."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe nurse must consider that older adults may have deficits in the ability to draw inferences, apply information, or understand major teaching points. Demonstration and practice are essential in meeting their learning needs. The other options are incorrect because the elderly may have problems reading and/or understanding a written pamphlet or verbal instructions. Having a family member change the dressing when the patient is capable of doing it impedes self-care and independence."

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAssessment in the teaching–learning process is directed toward the systematic collection of data about the person and family's learning needs and readiness to learn. Patient readiness is critical to accepting and integrating new information. Unless the patient is ready to accept new information, patient teaching will be ineffective. Citing the evidence base will not likely enhance learning. Patient guilt cannot be alleviated until the patient understands the intricacies of the condition and his physiologic response to the disease. Inclusion of colleagues can be beneficial, but this does not determine the success or failure of teaching."

It is best to demonstrate the skill and then give the learner ample opportunity for practice. By observing the patient using the inhaler, the nurse may identify what learning needs to be enhanced or reinforced. Asking questions is not as an accurate gauge of learning.

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIf a muscle is in disuse for an extended period of time, it is at risk of developing atrophy, which is the decrease in size. Clonus is a pattern of rhythmic muscle contractions and fasciculation is the involuntary twitch of muscle fibers; neither results from immobility. Lack of exercise is a risk factor for rheumatoid arthritis."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIt is important to encourage the patient to drink plenty of fluids to help distribute and eliminate the isotopic after it is injected. There are important contraindications to the procedure, include pregnancy or an allergy to the radioisotope. The test requires the injection of an intravenous radioisotope and the scan is preformed 2 to 3 hours after the isotope is injected. A calcium solution is not utilized."

        "Question": "A patient broke his arm in a sports accident and required the application of a cast. Shortly following application, the patient complained of an inability to straighten his fingers and was subsequently diagnosed with Volkmann contracture. What pathophysiologic process caused this complication?",
        "Choice 1": "Obstructed arterial blood flow to the forearm and hand",
        "Choice 2": "Simultaneous pressure on the ulnar and radial nerves",
        "Choice 3": "Irritation of Merkel cells in the patient's skin surfaces",
        "Choice 4": "Uncontrolled muscle spasms in the patient's forearm",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nVolkmann contracture occurs when arterial blood flow is restricted to the forearm and hand and results in contractures of the fingers and wrist. It does not result from nerve pressure, skin irritation, or spasms."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe hips should be kept in abduction by an abductor pillow. Hips should not be flexed more than 90 degrees, and the head of bed should not be elevated more than 60 degrees. The patient's hips should be higher than the knees; as such, high seat chairs should be used."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe hematoma may cause an interruption of tissue perfusion, so the most appropriate nursing diagnosis is Risk of Peripheral Neurovascular Dysfunction.  There is also an associated risk for infection because of the hematoma, but impaired neurovascular function is a more acute threat. Unilateral neglect and impaired sensation are lower priorities than neurovascular status."

        "Choice 2": "Release the weights and replace them immediately after positioning.",
        "Choice 3": "Reposition the bed instead of repositioning the patient.",
        "Choice 4": "Maintain consistent traction tension while repositioning.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nTraction is used to reduce the fracture and must be maintained at all times, including during repositioning. It would be inappropriate to add tension or release the weights. Moving the bed instead of the patient is not feasible."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nWorsening pain after a total hip replacement may indicate dislocation of the prosthesis. Assessment of pain should include evaluation of the wound and the affected extremity. Assuming he's anxious about discharge and administering pain medication do not address the cause of the pain. Sudden severe pain is not considered normal after hip replacement. Sudden pain is rarely indicative of a systemic infection."

        "Choice 1": "Allow the patient to continue to scratch inside the cast with a pencil but encourage him to be cautious.",
        "Choice 2": "Give the patient a sterile tongue depressor to use for scratching instead of the pencil.",
        "Choice 3": "Encourage the patient to avoid scratching, and obtain an order for an antihistamine if severe itching persists.",
        "Choice 4": "Obtain an order for a sedative, such as lorazepam (Ativan), to prevent the patient from scratching.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nScratching should be discouraged because of the risk for skin breakdown or damage to the cast. Most patients can be discouraged from scratching if given a mild antihistamine, such as diphenhydramine, to relieve itching. Benzodiazepines would not be given for this purpose."

        "Choice 2": "Have the patient reposition himself independently.",
        "Choice 3": "Protect the affected leg from internal rotation.",
        "Choice 4": "Keep the hip flexed by placing pillows under the patient's knee.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAbduction of the hip helps to prevent dislocation of a new hip joint. Rotation and adduction should be avoided. While the hip may be flexed slightly, it shouldn't exceed 90 degrees and maintenance of flexion isn't necessary. The patient may not be capable of safe independent repositioning at this early stage of recovery."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nKnots in the rope should not rest against pulleys, because this interferes with traction. Weights are used to apply the vector of force necessary to achieve effective traction and should hang freely at all times. To avoid interrupting traction, the limb in traction should not rest against anything. Skeletal traction is never interrupted."

        "Choice 3": "Balanced traction is portable and may accompany the patient's movements.",
        "Choice 4": "Balanced traction facilitates bone remodeling in as little as 4 days.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nOften, skeletal traction is balanced traction, which supports the affected extremity, allows for some patient movement, and facilitates patient independence and nursing care while maintaining effective traction. It is not portable, however, and it cannot be removed. Bone remodeling takes longer than 4 days."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe leg should be elevated to promote venous return and prevent edema. The cast shouldn't be covered while drying because this will cause heat buildup and prevent air circulation. No foreign object should be inserted inside the cast because of the risk of cutting the skin and causing an infection. A foul smell from a cast is never normal and may indicate an infection."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nBecause impaired circulation can cause permanent damage, neurovascular assessment of the affected leg is always a priority assessment. Leg shortening and internal or external rotation are common findings with a fractured hip. Pain, especially on movement, is also common after a hip fracture."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nTo prevent hip dislocation after a total hip replacement, the patient must avoid bending the hips beyond 90 degrees. Assistive devices, such as a raised toilet seat, should be used to prevent severe hip flexion. Using an abduction pillow or placing several pillows between the legs reduces the risk of hip dislocation by preventing adduction and internal rotation of the legs. Likewise, teaching the patient to avoid crossing the legs also reduces the risk of hip dislocation. A sock puller helps a patient get dressed without flexing the hips beyond 90 degrees."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe nurse educates the patient how to perform ankle and foot exercises within the limits of the traction therapy every 1 to 2 hours when awake to prevent DVT. Nutrition is important, but does not directly prevent DVT. Similarly, independence with ADLs should be promoted, but this does not confer significant prevention of DVT, which often affects the lower limbs. Plavix is not normally used for DVT prophylaxis."

The nurse notes that the site is now swollen and warm to the touch. The patient should undergo diagnostic testing for what health problem?",
        "Choice 1": "Osteomyelitis",
        "Choice 2": "Osteoporosis",
        "Choice 3": "Osteomalacia",
        "Choice 4": "Septic arthritis",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nWhen osteomyelitis develops from the spread of an adjacent infection, no signs of septicemia are present, but the area becomes swollen, warm, painful, and tender to touch. Osteoporosis is the most prevalent bone disease in the world. Osteomalacia is a metabolic bone disease characterized by inadequate mineralization of bone. Septicarthritis occurs when joints become infected through spread of infection from other parts of the body (hematogenous spread) or directly through trauma or surgical instrumentation."

        "Choice 4": "Increase circulation through frequent ambulation.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nTo control the edema in the foot of a patient who experienced foot surgery, the nurse will elevate the foot on several pillows when the patient is sitting or lying. Diuretic therapy is not an appropriate intervention for edema related to inflammation. Intermittent ice packs should be applied to the surgical area during the first 24 to 48 hours after surgery to control edema and provide some pain relief.

        "Choice 4": "Take corticosteroids as ordered.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nDiabetic foot ulcers have a high potential for progressing to osteomyelitis. Meticulous foot care can help mitigate this risk. Corticosteroids can exacerbate the risk of osteomyelitis. Increased intake of calcium and vitamins as well as regular exercise are beneficial health promotion exercises, but they do not directly reduce the risk of osteomyelitis."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe primary defect in osteomalacia is a deficiency of activated vitamin D, which promotes calcium absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and facilitates mineralization of bone. Interventions are aimed at resolving the processes underlying this deficiency. Maintenance of skin integrity is important, but is not the primary goal in care. Osteomalacia is not a malignant process. Overproduction (not underproduction) of PTH can cause the disease."

        "Choice 1": "Administer vitamin D and calcium supplements as ordered.",
        "Choice 2": "Monitor temperature and pulses of the affected extremity.",
        "Choice 3": "Perform passive range of motion exercises as tolerated.",
        "Choice 4": "Administer corticosteroids as ordered.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe nurse should include monitoring for sufficient blood supply by assessing the color, temperature, and pulses of the affected extremity. Weight-bearing exercises are encouraged, but passive ROM exercises have the potential to cause pain and inhibit healing. Corticosteroids, vitamin D, and calcium are not normally administered."

        "Question": "A nurse's assessment of a patient's knee reveals edema, tenderness, muscle spasms, and ecchymosis. The patient states that 2 days ago he ran 10 miles and now it “really hurts to stand up.” The nurse should plan care based on the belief that the patient has experienced what?",
        "Choice 1": "A first-degree strain",
        "Choice 2": "A second-degree strain",
        "Choice 3": "A first-degree sprain",
        "Choice 4": "A second-degree sprain",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nA second-degree strain involves tearing of muscle fibers and is manifested by notable loss of load-bearing strength with accompanying edema, tenderness, muscle spasm, and ecchymosis. A first-degree strain reflects tearing of a few muscle fibers and is accompanied by minor edema, tenderness, and mild muscle spasm, without noticeable loss of function. However, this patient states a loss of function. A sprain normally involves twisting, which is inconsistent with the patient's overuse injury."

        "Choice 4": "Keep an elastic compression bandage on the ankle.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nTreatment of a sprain consists of resting and elevating the affected part, applying cold, and using a compression bandage. After the acute inflammatory stage (usually 24 to 48 hours after injury), heat may be applied intermittently. Rotation exercises would likely be painful."

        "Choice 4": "Risk for Powerlessness",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe patient has a significant risk for osteomyelitis and tetanus due to the fact that the fracture is open. Powerlessness and ineffective role performance are psychosocial diagnoses that may or may not apply, and which would be superseded by immediate physiologic threats such as infection. Surgical positioning injury is not plausible, since surgery is not likely indicated."

        "Choice 1": "Avoid requesting analgesia unless pain becomes unbearable.",
        "Choice 2": "Use supplementary oxygen when transferring or mobilizing.",
        "Choice 3": "Increase fluid intake and perform prescribed foot exercises.",
        "Choice 4": "Remain on bed rest for 14 days or until instructed by the orthopedic surgeon.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nDeep vein thrombosis (DVT) is among the most common complications related to a hip fracture. To prevent DVT, the nurse encourages intake of fluids and ankle and foot exercises. The patient should not be told to endure pain; a proactive approach to pain control should be adopted. While respiratory complications commonly include atelectasis and pneumonia, the use of deep-breathing exercises, changes in position at least every 2 hours, and the use of incentive spirometry help prevent the respiratory complications more than using supplementary oxygen. Bed rest may be indicated in the short term, but is not normally required for 14 days."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPatients with an unstable fracture must have their spine in alignment at all times in order to prevent neurologic damage. This is a greater threat, and higher priority, than promoting function and preventing infection, even though these are both valid considerations. Increased ICP is not a high risk."

        "Choice 2": "“You will have minimal weight-bearing on this extremity but you'll be taught how to use an assistive device.”",
        "Choice 3": "“You likely will not be able to use this extremity but you will receive teaching on use of a wheelchair.”",
        "Choice 4": "“You will be fitted for a prosthesis which may or may not allow you to walk.”",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nSyme amputation (modified ankle disarticulation amputation) is performed most frequently for extensive foot trauma and produces a painless, durable extremity end that can withstand full weight-bearing.

The nurse recognizes the importance of implementing measures that focus on preventing flexion contracture of the hip and maintaining proper positioning. Which of the following measures will best achieve these goals?",
        "Choice 1": "Encouraging the patient to turn from side to side and to assume a prone position",
        "Choice 2": "Initiating ROM exercises of the hip and knee 10 to 12 weeks after the amputation",
        "Choice 3": "Minimizing movement of the flexor muscles of the hip",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe nurse encourages the patient to turn from side to side and to assume a prone position, if possible, to stretch the flexor muscles and to prevent flexion contracture of the hip. Postoperative ROM exercises are started early, because contracture deformities develop rapidly. ROM exercises include hip and knee exercises for patients with BKAs.

        "Choice 4": "Complex regional pain syndrome",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nFat embolism syndrome occurs most frequently in young adults and elderly patients who experience fractures of the proximal femur (i.e., hip fracture). Presenting features of fat embolism syndrome include hypoxia, tachypnea, tachycardia, and pyrexia. The respiratory distress response includes tachypnea, dyspnea, wheezes, precordial chest pain, cough, large amounts of thick, white sputum, and tachycardia.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPlacing a pillow between the patient's legs when turning prevents adduction and supports the patient's legs. Administering analgesics addresses pain but does not directly protect bone remodeling and promote healing. Rotation of the affected leg can cause dislocation and must be avoided. Prone positioning does not need to be maintained at all times."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPatients who have experienced sports-related injuries are often highly motivated to return to their previous level of activity. Adherence to restriction of activities and gradual resumption of activities needs to be reinforced. Appropriate analgesia use must be encouraged, but analgesia does not necessarily have to be taken in the absence of pain.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nFractures of the neck of the femur may damage the vascular system that supplies blood to the head and the neck of the femur, and the bone may become ischemic. For this reason, AVN is common in patients with femoral neck fractures. Infections are not immediate complications and phantom pain applies to patients with amputations, not hip fractures."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAcute compartment syndrome involves a sudden and severe decrease in blood flow to the tissues distal to an area of injury that results in ischemic necrosis if prompt, decisive intervention does not occur. Removing or bivalving the cast is necessary to relieve pressure. Ordering different analgesics does not address the underlying problem. Encouraging the patient to move the fingers or perform range-of-motion exercises will not treat or prevent compartment syndrome. Petaling the edges of a cast with tape prevents abrasions and skin breakdown, not compartment syndrome."

        "Question": "An advanced practice nurse is assessing the size and density of a patient's abdominal organs. If the results of palpation are unclear to the nurse, what assessment technique should be implemented?",
        "Choice 1": "Percussion",
        "Choice 2": "Auscultation",
        "Choice 3": "Inspection",
        "Choice 4": "Rectal examination",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPercussion is used to assess the size and density of the abdominal organs and to detect the presence of air-filled, fluid-filled, or solid masses. Percussion is used either independently or concurrently with palpation because it can validate palpation findings."

        "Question": "An inpatient has returned to the medical unit after a barium enema. When assessing the patient's subsequent bowel patterns and stools, what finding should the nurse report to the physician?",
        "Choice 1": "Large, wide stools",
        "Choice 2": "Milky white stools",
        "Choice 3": "Three stools during an 8-hour period of time",
        "Choice 4": "Streaks of blood present in the stool",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nBarium has a high osmolarity and may draw fluid into the bowel, thus increasing the intraluminal contents and resulting in greater output (large stools). The barium will give the stools a milky white appearance, and it is not uncommon for the patient to experience an increase in the number of bowel movements. Blood in fecal matter is not an expected finding and the nurse should notify the physician."

        "Choice 1": "Secretion of hydrochloric acid (HCl)",
        "Choice 2": "Reabsorption of water",
        "Choice 3": "Secretion of mucus",
        "Choice 4": "Absorption of nutrients",
        "Choice 5": "Movement of nutrients into the bloodstream",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "C,D,E",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe small intestine folds back and forth on itself, providing approximately 7000 cm2 (70 m2) of surface area for secretion and absorption, the process by which nutrients enter the bloodstream through the intestinal walls. Water reabsorption primarily takes place in the large bowel. HCl is secreted by the stomach."

        "Choice 1": "Splenic vein",
        "Choice 2": "Inferior mesenteric vein",
        "Choice 3": "Gastric vein",
        "Choice 4": "Inferior vena cava",
        "Choice 5": "Saphenous vein",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "A,B,C",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThis portal venous system is composed of five large veins: the superior mesenteric, inferior mesenteric, gastric, splenic, and cystic veins, which eventually form the vena portae that enters the liver.

        "Choice 1": "“Hydrochloric acid is secreted by glands in the stomach in response to the actual or anticipated presence of food.”",
        "Choice 2": "“As digestion occurs in the stomach, the stomach combines free hydrogen ions from the food to form acid.”",
        "Choice 3": "“The body requires an acidic environment in order to synthesize pancreatic digestive enzymes; the stomach provides this environment.”",
        "Choice 4": "“The acidic environment in the stomach exists to buffer the highly alkaline environment in the esophagus.”",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe stomach, which stores and mixes food with secretions, secretes a highly acidic fluid in response to the presence or anticipated ingestion of food. The stomach does not turn food directly into acid and the esophagus is not highly alkaline. Pancreatic enzymes are not synthesized in a highly acidic environment."

        "Choice 1": "Perform a focused abdominal assessment.",
        "Choice 2": "Prepare to meet the patient's psychosocial needs.",
        "Choice 3": "Liaise with the nurse practitioner to perform an anorectal examination.",
        "Choice 4": "Encourage the patient to adhere to recommended screening protocols.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nCEA is a protein that is normally not detected in the blood of a healthy person; therefore, when detected it indicates that cancer is present, but not what type of cancer is present. The patient would likely be learning that he or she has cancer, so the nurse must prioritize the patient's immediate psychosocial needs, not abdominal assessment. Future screening is not a high priority in the short term."

        "Choice 1": "The patient's BUN and creatinine levels are within reference range following the CT.",
        "Choice 2": "The CT yields high-quality images.",
        "Choice 3": "The patient's electrolytes are stable in the 48 hours following the CT.",
        "Choice 4": "The patient's intake and output are in balance on the day after the CT.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nBoth sodium bicarbonate and Mucomyst are free radical scavengers that sequester the contrast byproducts that are destructive to renal cells. Kidney damage would be evident by increased BUN and creatinine levels. These medications are unrelated to electrolyte or fluid balance and they play no role in the results of the CT."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nCA 19-9 levels are elevated in most patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, but they may also be elevated in other conditions such as colorectal, lung, and gallbladder cancers; gallstones; pancreatitis; cystic fibrosis; and liver disease. A cancer diagnosis cannot be made solely on CA 19-9 results."

Based on the patient's history, the physician suggests a colonoscopy, but the patient refuses, citing a strong aversion to the invasive nature of the test. What other test might the physician order to check for blood in the stool?",
        "Choice 1": "A laparoscopic intestinal mucosa biopsy",
        "Choice 2": "A quantitative fecal immunochemical test",
        "Choice 3": "Computed tomography (CT)",
        "Choice 4": "Magnetic resonance imagery (MRI)",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nQuantitative fecal immunochemical tests may be more accurate than guaiac testing and useful for patients who refuse invasive testing. CT or MRI cannot detect blood in stool. Laparoscopic intestinal mucosa biopsy is not performed."

        "Choice 1": "Abdominal lesions are usually due to age-related skin changes.",
        "Choice 2": "Integumentary diseases often cause GI disorders.",
        "Choice 3": "GI diseases often produce skin changes.",
        "Choice 4": "The patient needs to be assessed for self-harm.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAbdominal lesions are of particular importance, because GI diseases often produce skin changes. Skin problems do not normally cause GI disorders. Age-related skin changes do not have a pronounced effect on the skin of the abdomen when compared to other skin surfaces. Self-harm is a less likely explanation for skin lesions on the abdomen."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nRed meats, aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, turnips, and horseradish should be avoided for 72 hours prior to the study, because they may cause a false-positive result. Also, ingestion of vitamin C from supplements or foods can cause a false-negative result. Acidic foods do not need to be avoided."

        "Question": "A nurse is preparing to place a patient's ordered nasogastric tube. How should the nurse best determine the correct length of the nasogastric tube?",
        "Choice 1": "Place distal tip to nose, then ear tip and end of xiphoid process.",
        "Choice 2": "Instruct the patient to lie prone and measure tip of nose to umbilical area.",
        "Choice 3": "Insert the tube into the patient's nose until secretions can be aspirated.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nTube length is traditionally determined by (1) measuring the distance from the tip of the nose to the earlobe and from the earlobe to the xiphoid process, and (2) adding up to 6 inches for NG placement or at least 8 to 10 inches or more for intestinal placement, although studies do not necessarily confirm that this is a reliable technique. The physician would not prescribe a specific length and the umbilicus is not a landmark for this process. Length is not determined by aspirating from the tube.",

        "Choice 1": "Prime the tubing with 20 mL of normal saline.",
        "Choice 2": "Keep the vent lumen above the patient's waist.",
        "Choice 3": "Maintain the patient in a high Fowler's position.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe blue vent lumen should be kept above the patient's waist to prevent reflux of gastric contents through it; otherwise it acts as a siphon. A one-way anti-reflux valve seated in the blue pigtail can prevent the reflux of gastric contents out the vent lumen. To prevent reflux, the nurse does not prime the tubing, maintain the patient in a high Fowler's position, or have the patient pin the tube to the thigh."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nProtecting the client from aspirating is essential because aspiration can cause pneumonia, a potentially life-threatening disorder. Gastric ulcers are not a common complication of tube feeding in clients with ET tubes. Abdominal distention and diarrhea can both be associated with tube feeding, but prevention of these problems is not the primary rationale for confirming placement."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nWhen a concentrated solution of high osmolality entering the intestines is taken in quickly or in large amounts, water moves rapidly into the intestinal lumen from fluid surrounding the organs and the vascular compartment. This results in dumping syndrome. Dumping syndrome is not the result of changes in HCl or gastrin levels. It is not caused by an acid–base imbalance or direct irritation of the GI mucosa."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nGastrostomy is preferred over NG feedings in the patient who is comatose because the gastroesophageal sphincter remains intact, making regurgitation and aspiration less likely than with NG feedings. Both tubes carry a risk for infection; this change in care is not motivated by the possibility of faster infusion or easier personal care."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe nurse should avoid positioning the suction catheter on or near the graft suture lines. Application of suction in these areas could damage the graft. Self-sectioning may be unsafe because the patient may damage the suture line. Following a modified radical neck dissection with graft, the patient is usually positioned with the head of the bed elevated to promote drainage and reduce edema.  Assessing viability of the graft is important but is not part of the suctioning procedure and may delay initiating suctioning.  Maintenance of a patent airway is a nursing priority.  Similarly, the patient's ability to swallow is an important assessment for the nurse to make; however, it is not directly linked to the patient's need for suctioning."

The altered cells are considered precancerous and are a precursor to esophageal cancer.  In order to facilitate early detection of malignant cells, an upper endoscopy is recommended every 6 months. H2 receptor antagonists are commonly prescribed for patients with GERD; however, monitoring of liver enzymes is not routine.  Stools that contain evidence of frank bleeding or that are tarry are not expected and should be reported immediately.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nSince radical neck dissection involves removal of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, spinal accessory muscles, and cervical lymph nodes on one side of the neck, the patient's appearance is visibly altered.  The face generally appears asymmetric, with a visible neck depression; shoulder drop also occurs frequently.  These changes have the potential to negatively affect self-concept and body image. Facilitating adaptation to these changes is a crucial component of nursing intervention.  Patients who have had head and neck surgery generally report less pain as compared with other postoperative patients; however, the nurse must assess each individual patient's level of pain and response to analgesics.  Patients may experience transient hoarseness following a radical neck dissection; however, their ability to communicate is not permanently altered.

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAn esophageal diverticulum is an outpouching of mucosa and submucosa that protrudes through the esophageal musculature.  Food becomes trapped in the pouch and is frequently regurgitated when the patient assumes a recumbent position.  The patient may experience difficulty swallowing; however, burning pain is not a typical finding.  Symptoms mimicking a heart attack are characteristic of GERD.  Chronic parotid abscesses are not associated with a diagnosis of esophageal diverticulum."

        "Question": "A nurse is caring for a patient who is acutely ill and has included vigilant oral care in the patient's plan of care. Why are patients who are ill at increased risk for developing dental caries?",
        "Choice 1": "Hormonal changes brought on by the stress response cause an acidic oral environment",
        "Choice 2": "Systemic infections frequently migrate to the teeth",
        "Choice 3": "Hydration that is received intravenously lacks fluoride",
        "Choice 4": "Inadequate nutrition and decreased saliva production can cause cavities",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nMany ill patients do not eat adequate amounts of food and therefore produce less saliva, which in turn reduces the natural cleaning of the teeth. Stress response is not a factor, infections generally do not attack the enamel of the teeth, and the fluoride level of the patient is not significant in the development of dental caries in the ill patient."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nOral cancers are often associated with the use of alcohol and tobacco, which when used together have a synergistic carcinogenic effect. Most cases of oral cancers occur in people over the age of 60 and a disproportionate number of cases occur in men. Diabetes, dentures, dental caries, and GERD are not risk factors for oral cancer."

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPostoperatively, the nurse assesses for a patent airway. The patient's ability to manage secretions has a direct bearing on airway patency. However, airway patency is the overarching goal. This immediate physiologic need is prioritized over communication, though this is an important consideration. Infection is not normally a threat in the immediate postoperative period."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe lower esophageal sphincter, also called the gastroesophageal sphincter or cardiac sphincter, is located at the junction of the esophagus and the stomach. An incompetent lower esophageal sphincter allows reflux (backward flow) of gastric contents. The upper esophageal sphincter and the hypopharyngeal sphincter are synonymous and are not responsible for the manifestations of GERD.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nGlucagon is administered prior to removal of a foreign body because it relaxes the smooth muscle of the esophagus, facilitating insertion of the endoscope. Haloperidol is an antipsychotic drug and is not indicated. Prostigmine is prescribed for patients with myastheniagravis. It increases muscular contraction, an effect opposite that which is desired to facilitate removal of the foreign body. Epinephrine is indicated in asthma attack and bronchospasm."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nDeaths from malignancies of the head and neck are primarily attributable to local-regional metastasis to the cervical lymph nodes in the neck. This often occurs by way of the lymphatics before the primary lesion has been treated. This local-regional metastasis is not amenable to surgical resection and responds poorly to chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIn the immediate postoperative period, the nurse assesses for stridor (coarse, high-pitched sound on inspiration) by listening frequently over the trachea with a stethoscope. This finding must be reported immediately because it indicates obstruction of the airway. The patient's current status does not warrant activation of the emergency response system, and encouraging deep breathing and repositioning the patient are inadequate responses."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nSince vitamin B12 is absorbed in the stomach, the patient requires vitamin B12 replacement to prevent pernicious anemia. A gastrectomy precludes the use of a G tube. Since the stomach is absent, a nasogastric tube would not be indicated. As well, this is not possible in the home setting.  Since there is no stomach to act as a reservoir and fluids and nutrients are passing directly into the jejunum, distension is unlikely."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nH. pylori infection may be determined by endoscopy and histologic examination of a tissue specimen obtained by biopsy, or a rapid urease test of the biopsy specimen. Excessive stomach acid secretion leads to gastritis; however, peptic ulcers are caused by colonization of the stomach by H. pylori.

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nA severe form of acute gastritis is caused by the ingestion of strong acid or alkali, which may cause the mucosa to become gangrenous or to perforate. Scarring can occur, resulting in pyloric stenosis (narrowing or tightening) or obstruction. Chronic referred pain to the lower abdomen is a symptom of peptic ulcer disease, but would not be an expected finding for a patient who has ingested a corrosive substance.

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe patient's symptoms are characteristic of dumping syndrome, which results in a sensation of fullness, weakness, faintness, dizziness, palpitations, diaphoresis, cramping pains, and diarrhea. Aspiration is a less likely cause for the patient's symptoms. Supine positioning will likely exacerbate the symptoms and insertion of an NG tube is contraindicated due to the nature of the patient's surgery."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThough antiobesity drugs help some patients lose weight, their use rarely results in loss of more than 10% of total body weight.

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nEncouraging the patient to discuss his or her fears and anxieties is usually the best way to assess a patient's anxiety. Presenting hypothetical situations is a surreptitious and possibly inaccurate way of assessing anxiety. Observing body language is part of assessment, but it is not the complete assessment.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nWhen the bowel is completely obstructed, the possibility of strangulation and tissue necrosis (i.e., tissue death) warrants surgical intervention. As such, this immediate physiologic need is a nursing priority. Nutritional support and management of anxiety are necessary, but bowel ischemia is a more immediate threat. Skin integrity is not threatened."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAlthough most polyps do not develop into invasive neoplasms, they must be identified and followed closely. They are very common, but are not classified as a normal, age-related physiologic change. Diet will not help them resolve and they do not typically lead to obstructions."

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nEmotional support from the family is key to the patient's coping after discharge. A 21-year-old would be expected to self-manage the prescribed medication regimen and the family would not be primarily responsible for monitoring the patient's health status. It is highly beneficial if the family is willing and able to accommodate the patient's dietary needs, but emotional support is paramount and cannot be solely provided by the patient alone."

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe patient with a diagnosis of appendicitis has an acute risk of infection related to the possibility of rupture. This immediate physiologic risk is a priority over nutrition and constipation, though each of these concerns should be addressed by the nurse. The pain associated with appendicitis is acute, not chronic."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nA wound-ostomy-continence (WOC) nurse is a registered nurse who has received advanced education in an accredited program to care for patients with stomas. The enterostomal nurse therapist can assist with the selection of an appropriate stoma site, teach about stoma care, and provide emotional support.

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe hallmarks of malabsorption syndrome from any cause are diarrhea or frequent, loose, bulky, foul-smelling stools that have increased fat content and are often grayish (steatorrhea). Constipation and bloody bowel movements are not suggestive of malabsorption syndromes. Fever and a tender, rigid abdomen are associated with peritonitis."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIt is important to report nausea and abdominal distention, which may indicate intestinal obstruction. This requires prompt medical intervention. Referral to the WOC nurse is not an appropriate short-term response, since medical treatment is necessary. Physical mobility will not normally resolve an obstruction. There is no need to collect a culture from the stoma, because infection is unrelated to this problem."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nSurgical resection is the treatment of choice when HCC is confined to one lobe of the liver and the function of the remaining liver is considered adequate for postoperative recovery. Removal of a lobe of the liver (lobectomy) is the most common surgical procedure for excising a liver tumor. While cryosurgery and liver transplantation are other surgical options for management of liver cancer, these procedures are not performed at the same frequency as a lobectomy.

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe sudden hemorrhage that accompanies variceal bleeding is intensely anxiety-provoking. The nurse must address the patient's likely fear of death, which is a realistic possibility. For most patients, anxiety is likely to be a more acute concern than lack of knowledge or decisional conflict. The patient may or may not experience disturbances in thought processes."

        "Choice 1": "Arterial line",
        "Choice 2": "Diuretics",
        "Choice 3": "Foley catheter",
        "Choice 4": "Volume expanders",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nBecause patients with bleeding esophageal varices have intravascular volume depletion and are subject to electrolyte imbalance, IV fluids with electrolytes and volume expanders are provided to restore fluid volume and replace electrolytes. Diuretics would reduce vascular volume. An arterial line and Foley catheter are likely to be ordered, but neither actively maintains the patient's volume."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nRecovery from acute toxic hepatitis is rapid if the hepatotoxin is identified early and removed or if exposure to the agent has been limited. Recovery is unlikely if there is a prolonged period between exposure and onset of symptoms. There are no effective antidotes. The fever rises; the patient becomes toxic and prostrated. Vomiting may be persistent, with the emesis containing blood. Clotting abnormalities may be severe, and hemorrhages may appear under the skin. The severe GI symptoms may lead to vascular collapse. Delirium, coma, and seizures develop, and within a few days the patient may die of fulminant hepatic failure unless he or she receives a liver transplant."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nMonitoring is an essential nursing function to identify early deterioration in mental status. The nurse monitors the patient's mental status closely and reports changes so that treatment of encephalopathy can be initiated promptly. This change in status is likely unrelated to sodium intake and would not signal the onset of hepatitis. A supportive care environment is beneficial, but does not address the patient's physiologic deterioration."

You note bruising to the patient's upper arm that correspond to the outline of fingers as well as yellow bruising around her left eye. The patient makes minimal eye contact during the assessment. How might you best inquire about the bruising?",
        "Choice 1": "“Is anyone physically hurting you?”",
        "Choice 2": "“Tell me about your relationships.”",
        "Choice 3": "“Do you want to see a social worker?”",
        "Choice 4": "“Is there something you want to tell me?”",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nFew patients will discuss the topic of abuse unless they are directly asked. Therefore, it is important to ask direct questions, such as, “Is anyone physically hurting you?” The other options are incorrect because they are not the best way to illicit information about possible abuse in a direct and appropriate manner."

        "Choice 1": "“This history helps us determine what your needs may be for nursing care.”",
        "Choice 2": "“You are right; this may seem redundant and I'm sure that it's frustrating for you.”",

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nRegardless of the assessment format used, the focus of nurses during data collection is different from that of physicians and other health team members. Explaining to the patient the purpose of the nursing assessment creates a better understanding of what the nurse does. It also gives the patient an opportunity to add his or her own input into the patient's care plan. The nurse should address the patient's concerns directly and avoid casting doubt on the thoroughness of the physician."

        "Choice 1": "The patient may be at risk for developing diabetes.",
        "Choice 2": "The patient may need teaching on the effects of diabetes.",
        "Choice 3": "The patient may need to attend a support group for individuals with diabetes.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nNurses incorporate a genetics focus into the health assessments of family history to assess for genetics-related risk factors. The information aids the nurse in determining if the patient may be predisposed to diseases that are genetic in origin. The results of diabetes testing would determine whether dietary changes, support groups or health education would be needed."

During the nursing assessment, the nurse asks the patient questions related to his spirituality. What is the primary rationale for this aspect of the nurse's assessment?",
        "Choice 1": "The patient's spiritual environment can affect his physical activity.",
        "Choice 2": "The patient's spiritual environment can affect his ability to communicate.",
        "Choice 3": "The patient's spiritual environment can affect his quality of sexual relationships.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIllness may cause a spiritual crisis and can place considerable stresses on a person's internal resources. The term spiritual environment refers to the degree to which a person has contemplated his or her own existence. The other listed options may be right, but they are not the most important reasons for a nurse to assess a patient's spiritual environment."

        "Choice 1": "The patient does not understand the principles of nutrition.",
        "Choice 2": "This is an aspect of the patient's religious practice.",
        "Choice 3": "This constitutes a nursing diagnosis of Risk for Imbalanced Nutrition.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nBecause this datum was obtained during a spiritual assessment, it could be that this is an aspect of the patient's religious practice. It is indeed a personal choice, but this is not the primary significance of the statement. This practice may not be related to health-seeking if it is in fact a religious practice.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPalpation is a part of the assessment that allows the nurse to assess a body part through touch. Many structures of the body (superficial blood vessels, lymph nodes, thyroid gland, organs of the abdomen, pelvis, and rectum), although not visible, may be assessed through the techniques of light and deep palpation. The other options are incorrect because lymph nodes are not assessed through inspection, auscultation, or percussion."

People who have a BMI lower than 24 (or who are 80% or less of their desirable body weight for height) are at increased risk for problems associated with poor nutritional status.

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPatients with ill-fitting dentures are at a potential risk for an inadequate intake of high-fiber foods. The elderly are already at an increased risk for constipation because of other developmental factors and the potential for a decreased activity level. Ill-fitting dentures do not put a patient at risk for dehydration, malabsorption of nutrients, or a reliance on convenience foods."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe chief complaint should clearly address what has brought the patient to see the health care provider; an open-ended question best serves this purpose. The question “What brings you to the hospital?” allows the patient sufficient latitude to provide an answer that expresses the priority issue.

        "Choice 1": "“Do you feel any of your cultural practices have a negative impact on your disease process?”",
        "Choice 2": "“What types of foods are served as a part of your cultural practices, and how are they prepared?”",
        "Choice 3": "“As a nonnative, I am unaware of your cultural practices. Could you teach me a few practices that may affect your care?”",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe beliefs and practices that have been shared from generation to generation are known as cultural or ethnic patterns. Food plays a significant role in both cultural practices and type 2 diabetes. By asking the question, “Tell me about the foods that are important in your culture and how you feel they influence your diabetes,” the nurse demonstrates a cultural awareness to the client and allows an open-ended discussion of the disease process and its relationship to cultural practice. An overemphasis on negatives can inhibit assessment and communication. Assessing the types and preparation of foods specific to cultural practices without relating it to diabetes is inadequate. The question, “As a nonnative, I am unaware of your cultural practices. Could you teach me a few practices that may affect your care?” focuses on “care” and fails to address the significance of food in cultural practice or diabetes."

        "Choice 1": "“Listening to the body is called auscultation. It is done with the diaphragm, and it requires a trained ear to hear a murmur.”",
        "Choice 2": "“Listening is called palpation, and I would be glad to help you to palpate your murmur.”",

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nListening with a stethoscope is auscultation and it is done with both the bell and diaphragm. The diaphragm is used to assess high-frequency sounds such as systolic heart murmurs, whereas the bell is used to assess low-frequency sounds such as diastolic heart murmurs. It is also important to provide education whenever possible and actively include the patient in the plan of care. Teaching an interested patient how to listen to a murmur should be encouraged.

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAuscultation should always be performed with the diaphragm placed firmly on the skin to minimize extra noise and with the bell lightly placed on the skin to reduce distortion caused by vibration.

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nCulture and religious practices together often determine whether certain foods are prohibited and whether certain foods and spices are eaten on certain holidays or at specific family gatherings. A specific focus on holidays, however, does not convey the overall intent of the dietary interview. Dietary planning addresses all patients' needs, not only those who are born outside the United States. It is inappropriate to characterize a patient's diet as “unusual.”"

The nurse should remind patients to take deep breaths and cough to expand the lungs fully and prevent atelectasis. Acute pain is an expected assessment finding following surgery; analgesics should be administered for pain relief. Abdominal splinting or application of an abdominal binder may assist in reducing the pain. Bile may continue to drain from the drainage tract after surgery, which will require frequent changes of the abdominal dressing.

        "Question": "A nurse is caring for a patient who has been scheduled for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) the following day. When providing anticipatory guidance for this patient, the nurse should describe what aspect of this diagnostic procedure?",
        "Choice 1": "The need to protect the incision postprocedure",
        "Choice 2": "The use of moderate sedation",
        "Choice 3": "The need to infuse 50% dextrose during the procedure",
        "Choice 4": "The use of general anesthesia",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nModerate sedation, not general anesthesia, is used during ERCP. D50 is not administered and the procedure does not involve the creation of an incision."

        "Question": "A patient has undergone a laparoscopic cholecystectomy and is being prepared for discharge home. When providing health education, the nurse should prioritize which of the following topics?",
        "Choice 1": "Management of fluid balance in the home setting",
        "Choice 2": "The need for blood glucose monitoring for the next week",
        "Choice 3": "Signs and symptoms of intra-abdominal complications",
        "Choice 4": "Appropriate use of prescribed pancreatic enzymes",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nBecause of the early discharge following laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the patient needs thorough education in the signs and symptoms of complications. Fluid balance is not typically a problem in the recovery period after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. There is no need for blood glucose monitoring or pancreatic enzymes."

        "Choice 1": "Disturbed Body Image",
        "Choice 2": "Impaired Skin Integrity",
        "Choice 3": "Nausea",
        "Choice 4": "Risk for Deficient Fluid Volume",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nWhile each of the diagnoses may be applicable to a patient with pancreatic drainage, the priority nursing diagnosis is Impaired Skin Integrity. The drainage is often perfuse and destructive to tissue because of the enzyme contents. Nursing measures must focus on steps to protect the skin near the drainage site from excoriation. The application of ointments or the use of a suction apparatus protects the skin from excoriation."

        "Question": "A home health nurse is caring for a patient discharged home after pancreatic surgery. The nurse documents the nursing diagnosis Risk for Imbalanced Nutrition: Less than Body Requirements on the care plan based on the potential complications that may occur after surgery. What are the most likely complications for the patient who has had pancreatic surgery?",
        "Choice 1": "Proteinuria and hyperkalemia",
        "Choice 2": "Hemorrhage and hypercalcemia",
        "Choice 3": "Weight loss and hypoglycemia",
        "Choice 4": "Malabsorption and hyperglycemia",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe nurse arrives at this diagnosis based on the complications of malabsorption and hyperglycemia. These complications often lead to the need for dietary modifications. Pancreatic enzyme replacement, a low-fat diet, and vitamin supplementation often are also required to meet the patient's nutritional needs and restrictions. Electrolyte imbalances often accompany pancreatic disorders and surgery, but the electrolyte levels are more often deficient than excessive. Hemorrhage is a complication related to surgery, but not specific to the nutritionally based nursing diagnosis. Weight loss is a common complication, but hypoglycemia is less likely."

        "Choice 2": "Application of heat 15 to 20 minutes each hour",
        "Choice 3": "Application of an ice pack for no more than 15 minutes",
        "Choice 4": "Application of liniment rub to affected area",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIf pain occurs in the right shoulder or scapular area (from migration of the CO2 used to insufflate the abdominal cavity during the procedure), the nurse may recommend use of a heating pad for 15 to 20 minutes hourly, walking, and sitting up when in bed. Aspirin would constitute a risk for bleeding."

        "Choice 3": "Wound evisceration",
        "Choice 4": "Bile duct injury",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe most serious complication after laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a bile duct injury. Patients do not face a risk of diabetic coma. A decubitus ulcer is unlikely because immobility is not expected. Evisceration is highly unlikely, due to the laparoscopic approach."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAfter the acute attack has subsided, some patients may be inclined to return to their previous drinking habits. The nurse provides specific information about resources and support groups that may be of assistance in avoiding alcohol in the future. Referral to Alcoholics Anonymous as appropriate or other support groups is essential. The patient already has an understanding of the effects of alcohol, and follow-up appointments will not necessarily result in lifestyle changes. Social work and spiritual care may or may not be beneficial."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe nurse maintains the patient in a semi-Fowler's position to decrease pressure on the diaphragm by a distended abdomen and to increase respiratory expansion. A supine position will result in increased pressure on the diaphragm and potentially decreased respiratory expansion. Steroids and oral suctioning are not indicated."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nUrsodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has been used to dissolve small, radiolucent gallstones composed primarily of cholesterol. This drug can reduce the size of existing stones, dissolve small stones, and prevent new stones from forming. Six to 12 months of therapy is required in many patients to dissolve stones, and monitoring of the patient is required during this time. The effective dose of medication depends on body weight."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe diet immediately after an episode of acute cholecystitis is initially limited to low-fat liquids. Cooked fruits, rice or tapioca, lean meats, mashed potatoes, bread, and coffee or tea may be added as tolerated. The patient should avoid fried foods such as fried chicken, as fatty foods may bring on an episode of cholecystitis."

        "Question": "A patient with a cholelithiasis has been scheduled for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Why is laparoscopic cholecystectomy preferred by surgeons over an open procedure?",
        "Choice 1": "Laparoscopic cholecystectomy poses fewer surgical risks than an open procedure.",
        "Choice 2": "Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed in a clinic setting, while an open procedure requires an OR.",
        "Choice 3": "A laparoscopic approach allows for the removal of the entire gallbladder.",
        "Choice 4": "A laparoscopic approach can be performed under conscious sedation.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nOpen surgery has largely been replaced by laparoscopic cholecystectomy (removal of the gallbladder through a small incision through the umbilicus). As a result, surgical risks have decreased, along with the length of hospital stay and the long recovery period required after standard surgical cholecystectomy. Both approaches allow for removal of the entire gallbladder and must be performed under general anesthetic in an operating theater."

The physician has prescribed an oral antidiabetic agent that will inhibit the production of glucose by the liver and thereby aid in the control of blood glucose. What type of oral antidiabetic agent did the physician prescribe for this patient?",
        "Choice 1": "A sulfonylurea",
        "Choice 2": "A biguanide",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nSulfonylureas exert their primary action by directly stimulating the pancreas to secrete insulin and therefore require a functioning pancreas to be effective. Biguanides inhibit the production of glucose by the liver and are in used in type 2 diabetes to control blood glucose levels. Thiazolidinediones enhance insulin action at the receptor site without increasing insulin secretion from the beta cells of the pancreas. Alpha glucosidase inhibitors work by delaying the absorption of glucose in the intestinal system, resulting in a lower postprandial blood glucose level."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe most important issue to teach patients with diabetes who become ill is not to eliminate insulin doses when nausea and vomiting occur. Rather, they should take their usual insulin or oral hypoglycemic agent dose, then attempt to consume frequent, small portions of carbohydrates. In general, blood sugar levels will rise but should be reported if they are greater than 300 mg/dL."

        "Choice 1": "“The tissues in your body are resistant to the action of insulin, making the glucose levels in your blood increase.”",
        "Choice 2": "“Damage to your pancreas causes an increase in the amount of glucose that it releases, and there is not enough insulin to control it.”",
        "Choice 3": "“The amount of glucose that your body makes overwhelms your pancreas and decreases your production of insulin.”",
        "Choice 4": "“Destruction of special cells in the pancreas causes a decrease in insulin production. Glucose levels rise because insulin normally breaks it down.”",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nType 1 diabetes is characterized by the destruction of pancreatic beta cells, resulting in decreased insulin production, unchecked glucose production by the liver, and fasting hyperglycemia. Also, glucose derived from food cannot be stored in the liver and remains circulating in the blood, which leads to postprandial hyperglycemia. Type 2 diabetes involves insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion. The body does not “make” glucose."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nInsulin resistance is associated with obesity; thus the primary treatment of type 2 diabetes is weight loss. Oral antidiabetic agents may be added if diet and exercise are not successful in controlling blood glucose levels. If maximum doses of a single category of oral agents fail to reduce glucose levels to satisfactory levels, additional oral agents may be used. Some patients may require insulin on an ongoing basis or on a temporary basis during times of acute psychological stress, but it is not the central component of type 2 treatment.

        "Question": "A 28-year-old pregnant woman is spilling sugar in her urine. The physician orders a glucose tolerance test, which reveals gestational diabetes. The patient is shocked by the diagnosis, stating that she is conscientious about her health, and asks the nurse what causes gestational diabetes. The nurse should explain that gestational diabetes is a result of what etiologic factor?",
        "Choice 1": "Increased caloric intake during the first trimester",
        "Choice 2": "Changes in osmolality and fluid balance",
        "Choice 3": "The effects of hormonal changes during pregnancy",

Upon being admitted to the hospital for a cholecystectomy, however, the patient has required insulin injections on two occasions. The nurse would identify what likely cause for this short-term change in treatment?",
        "Choice 1": "Alterations in bile metabolism and release have likely caused hyperglycemia.",
        "Choice 2": "Stress has likely caused an increase in the patient's blood sugar levels.",
        "Choice 3": "The patient has likely overestimated her ability to control her diabetes using nonpharmacologic measures.",
        "Choice 4": "The patient's volatile fluid balance surrounding surgery has likely caused unstable blood sugars.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nDuring periods of physiologic stress, such as surgery, blood glucose levels tend to increase, because levels of stress hormones (epinephrine, norepinephrine, glucagon, cortisol, and growth hormone) increase. The patient's need for insulin is unrelated to the action of bile, the patient's overestimation of previous blood sugar control, or fluid imbalance."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe etiology of neuropathy may involve elevated blood glucose levels over a period of years.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIn keeping with the natural secretion of cortisol, the best time of day for the total corticosteroid dose is in the morning from 7 to 8 AM. Large-dose therapy at 8 AM, when the adrenal gland is most active, produces maximal suppression of the gland. Also, a large 8 AM dose is more physiologic because it allows the body to escape effects of the steroids from 4 PM to 6 AM, when serum levels are normally low, thus minimizing cushingoid effects."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe patient will need to supplement dietary intake with added salt during episodes of GI losses of fluid through vomiting and diarrhea to prevent the onset of addisonian crisis. While the patient may experience the loss of other electrolytes, the major concern is the replacement of lost sodium."

        "Choice 4": "Ambulation and activity as tolerated",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nMobility, with walking or use of a rocking chair for those with limited mobility, is encouraged as much as possible because bones subjected to normal stress give up less calcium. Best rest should be discouraged because it increases calcium excretion and the risk of renal calculi. Limiting the patient to getting out of bed only a few times a day also increases calcium excretion and the associated risks."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nManipulation of the tumor during surgical excision may cause release of stored epinephrine and norepinephrine, with marked increases in BP and changes in heart rate. The use of sodium nitroprusside and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents may be required during and after surgery. While other vital sign changes may occur related to surgical complications, the most common changes are related to hypertension and changes in the heart rate."

        "Choice 2": "Hypophosphatemia",
        "Choice 3": "Hypocalcemia",
        "Choice 4": "Hypokalemia",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nInjury or removal of the parathyroid glands may produce a disturbance in calcium metabolism and result in a decline of calcium levels (hypocalcemia). As the blood calcium levels fall, hyperirritability of the nerves occurs, with spasms of the hands and feet and muscle twitching. This group of symptoms is known as tetany and must be reported to the physician immediately, because laryngospasm may occur and obstruct the airway. Hypophosphatemia, hyponatremia, and hypokalemia are not expected responses to parathyroid injury or removal. In fact, parathyroid removal or injury that results in hypocalcemia may lead to hyperphosphatemia."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nA patient with hyperthyroidism has an increased appetite. The patient should be counseled to consume several small, well-balanced meals. High-calorie, high-protein foods are encouraged. A clear liquid diet would not satisfy the patient's caloric or hunger needs. A diet rich in fiber and fat should be avoided because these foods may lead to GI upset or increase peristalsis."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe priority nursing diagnosis for a patient with SIADH is excess fluid volume, as the patient retains fluids and develops a sodium deficiency. Restricting fluid intake is a typical intervention for managing this syndrome. Temperature imbalances are not associated with SIADH. The patient is not at risk for neurovascular dysfunction or a compromised airway."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAn adrenal response to the administration of a stimulating hormone suggests inadequate production of the stimulating hormone. In this case, ACTH is produced by the pituitary and, consequently, pituitary hypofunction is suggested. Hypothalamic function is not relevant to the physiology of this problem. Treatment exists, although surgery is not likely indicated."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nDullness to percussion of the bladder following voiding indicates incomplete bladder emptying. Enlargement of the kidneys can be attributed to numerous conditions such as polycystic kidney disease or hydronephrosis and is not related to bladder fullness. Dehydration and ureteral obstruction are not related to bladder fullness; in fact, these conditions result in decreased flow of urine to the bladder."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nUltrasonography requires a full bladder; therefore, fluid intake should be encouraged before the procedures. The administration of a radiopaque contrast agent is required to perform IV urography studies, such as an IV pyelogram. Ultrasonography is a quick and painless diagnostic test and does not require sedation or intubation. The injection of a radioisotope is required for nuclear scan and ultrasonography is not in this category of diagnostic studies."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nUrine specific gravity depends largely on hydration status. A decrease in fluid intake will lead to an increase in the urine specific gravity. With high fluid intake, specific gravity decreases. In patients with kidney disease, urine specific gravity does not vary with fluid intake, and the patient's urine is said to have a fixed specific gravity."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nRetention of potassium is the most life-threatening effect of renal failure.\r\nAldosterone causes the kidney to excrete potassium, in contrast to aldosterone's effects on sodium described previously. Acid–base balance, the amount of dietary potassium intake, and the flow rate of the filtrate in the distal tubule also influence the amount of potassium secreted into the urine. Hypocalcemia, the accumulation of wastes, and lack of BP control are complications associated with renal failure, but do not have same level of threat to the patient's well-being as hyperkalemia."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe various substances normally filtered by the glomerulus, reabsorbed by the tubules, and excreted in the urine include sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, potassium, glucose, urea, creatinine, and uric acid. Within the tubule, some of these substances are selectively reabsorbed into the blood. Glucose is completely reabsorbed in the tubule and normally does not appear in the urine. However, glucose is found in the urine if the amount of glucose in the blood and glomerular filtrate exceeds the amount that the tubules are able to reabsorb. Protein molecules are also generally not found in the urine because amino acids are also filtered at the level of the glomerulus and reabsorbed so that it is not excreted in the urine."

        "Choice 4": "Urethra",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nUreteral pain is characterized as a dull continuous pain that may be intense with voiding. The pain may be described as sharp or stabbing if the bladder is full. This type of pain is inconsistent with a stone being present in the bladder. Stones are not normally situated in the urethra or meatus."

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nHematuria and renal colic are common and expected findings after the performance of a renal brush biopsy. The physician should be notified of the patient's body temperature, which likely indicates the onset of an infectious process. IV infiltration does not warrant notification of the primary care physician."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPreparation for an open biopsy is similar to that for any major abdominal surgery.  When preparing the patient for an open biopsy you would keep the patient NPO. You may discuss the diagnosis with the family, but that is not a preparation for the procedure. A pre-procedure wash is not normally ordered and antivirals are not administered in anticipation of a biopsy."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nRenal glycosuria can occur on its own as a benign condition.

        "Choice 4": "Excreting bicarbonate in the urine",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe kidney performs two major functions to assist in acid–base balance. The first is to reabsorb and return to the body's circulation any bicarbonate from the urinary filtrate; the second is to excrete acid in the urine. Retaining bicarbonate will counteract an acidotic state. The nephrons do not sequester free hydrogen ions."

        "Choice 1": "The kidneys will excrete increased quantities of acid.",
        "Choice 2": "Bicarbonate will be released from the adrenal medulla.",
        "Choice 3": "Alveoli in the lungs will synthesize new bicarbonate.",
        "Choice 4": "Renal tubular cells will generate new bicarbonate.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nTo replace any lost bicarbonate, the renal tubular cells generate new bicarbonate through a variety of chemical reactions. This newly generated bicarbonate is then reabsorbed by the tubules and returned to the body. The lungs and adrenal glands do not synthesize bicarbonate. Excretion of acid compensates for a lack of bicarbonate, but it does not actively replace it."

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe nurse emphasizes the need to drink throughout the day even if the patient does not feel thirsty, because the thirst stimulation is decreased. Four liters of daily fluid intake is excessive and fluids other than water are acceptable in most cases. Additional salt intake is not recommended as a prompt for increased fluid intake."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nOsmolality is the most accurate measurement of the kidney's ability to dilute and concentrate urine. Osmolality is not a direct indicator of renal function as it relates to erythropoietin synthesis or maintenance of acid–base balance. It does not indicate the maintenance of healthy levels of potassium, the vast majority of which is excreted."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAlthough historically hematocrit has been the blood test of choice when assessing a patient for anemia, use of the hemoglobin level rather than hematocrit is currently recommended, because that measurement is a better assessment of the oxygen transport ability of the blood. ESR and creatinine levels are not indicative of oxygen transport ability."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe deep tendon reflexes of the knee are examined for quality and symmetry. This is an important part of testing for neurologic causes of bladder dysfunction, because the sacral area, which innervates the lower extremities, is in the same peripheral nerve area responsible for urinary continence. Neurologic function does not directly influence the course of renal calculi, BPH or UTIs."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nVoiding in the presence of others can frequently cause guarding, a natural reflex that inhibits voiding due to situational anxiety. Because the outcomes of these studies determine the plan of care, the nurse must help the patient relax by providing as much privacy and explanation about the procedure as possible. Diuretics and increased fluid intake would not address the patient's anxiety. It would be inappropriate and anxiety-provoking to discuss test results during the performance of the test."

        "Question": "The nurse is caring for a patient receiving hemodialysis three times weekly. The patient has had surgery to form an arteriovenous fistula. What is most important for the nurse to be aware of when providing care for this patient?",
        "Choice 1": "Using a stethoscope for auscultating the fistula is contraindicated.",
        "Choice 2": "The patient feels best immediately after the dialysis treatment.",
        "Choice 3": "Taking a BP reading on the affected arm can damage the fistula.",
        "Choice 4": "The patient should not feel pain during initiation of dialysis.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nWhen blood flow is reduced through the access for any reason (hypotension, application of BP cuff/tourniquet), the access site can clot. Auscultation of a bruit in the fistula is one way to determine patency. Typically, patients feel fatigued immediately after hemodialysis because of the rapid change in fluid and electrolyte status. Although the area over the fistula may have some decreased sensation, a needle stick is still painful."

        "Question": "A football player is thought to have sustained an injury to his kidneys from being tackled from behind. The ER nurse caring for the patient reviews the initial orders written by the physician and notes that an order to collect all voided urine and send it to the laboratory for analysis. The nurse understands that this nursing intervention is important for what reason?",
        "Choice 1": "Hematuria is the most common manifestation of renal trauma and blood losses may be microscopic, so laboratory analysis is essential.",
        "Choice 2": "Intake and output calculations are essential and the laboratory will calculate the precise urine output produced by this patient.",
        "Choice 3": "A creatinine clearance study may be ordered at a later time and the laboratory will hold all urine until it is determined if the test will be necessary.",
        "Choice 4": "There is great concern about electrolyte imbalances and the laboratory will monitor the urine for changes in potassium and sodium concentrations.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nHematuria is the most common manifestation of renal trauma; its presence after trauma suggests renal injury. Hematuria may not occur, or it may be detectable only on microscopic examination. All urine should be saved and sent to the laboratory for analysis to detect RBCs and to evaluate the course of bleeding. Measuring intake and output is not a function of the laboratory. The laboratory does not save urine to test creatinine clearance at a later time. The laboratory does not monitor the urine for sodium or potassium concentrations."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nHemodialysis is the most commonly used method of dialysis.

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPeritonitis is the most common and serious complication of peritoneal dialysis. The first sign of peritonitis is cloudy dialysate drainage fluid, so prompt reporting to the primary care provider and rapid assessment for other signs of infection are warranted. Administration of an IV bolus is not necessary or appropriate and the physician would determine whether removal of the catheter is required. Flushing the catheter does not address the risk for infection."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "A,B,D",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nRestricting dietary protein decreases the accumulation of nitrogenous wastes, reduces uremic symptoms, and may even postpone the initiation of dialysis for a few months. Restriction of fluid is also part of the dietary prescription because fluid accumulation may occur. As well, sodium is usually restricted to 2 to 3 g/day. Potassium intake is usually limited, not increased, and there is no particular need for vitamin D supplementation."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nRadiocontrast-induced nephropathy is a major cause of hospital-acquired acute kidney injury. Baseline levels of creatinine greater than 2 mg/dL identify the patient as being high risk. Preprocedure hydration and prescription of acetylcysteine (Mucomyst) the day prior to the test is effective in prevention. The nurse would not monitor the patient's electrolytes every hour preprocedure. Nothing in the scenario indicates the need for hemodialysis. A creatinine clearance is not necessary prior to a CT scan with contrast."

The patient is hemodynamically unstable, but renal replacement therapy is needed to manage the patient's hypervolemia and hyperkalemia. Which of the following therapies will the patient's hemodynamic status best tolerate?",
        "Choice 1": "Hemodialysis",
        "Choice 2": "Peritoneal dialysis",
        "Choice 3": "Continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD)",
        "Choice 4": "Plasmapheresis",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nCVVHD facilitates the removal of uremic toxins and fluid. The hemodynamic effects of CVVHD are usually mild in comparison to hemodialysis, so CVVHD is best tolerated by an unstable patient. Peritoneal dialysis is not the best choice, as the patient may have sustained abdominal injuries during the accident and catheter placement would be risky. Plasmapheresis does not achieve fluid removal and electrolyte balance."

The nurse monitors for complications, participates in emergency treatment of fluid and electrolyte imbalances, assesses the patient's progress and response to treatment, and provides physical and emotional support. Additionally, the nurse keeps family members informed about the patient's condition, helps them understand the treatments, and provides psychological support. Although the development of AKI may be the most serious problem, the nurse continues to provide nursing care indicated for the primary disorder (e.g., burns, shock, trauma, obstruction of the urinary tract). The nurse does not direct the patient's nutritional status; the dietician and the physician normally collaborate on directing the patient's nutritional status."

The patient tells the nurse she is not sure she wants to undergo a kidney transplant. What would be an appropriate response for the nurse to make?",
        "Choice 1": "“The decision is certainly yours to make, but be sure not to make a mistake.”",
        "Choice 2": "“Kidney transplants in patients your age are as successful as they are in younger patients.”",

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nStress incontinence is the involuntary loss of urine through an intact urethra as a result of sudden increase in intra-abdominal pressure. Reflex incontinence is loss of urine due to hyperreflexia or involuntary urethral relaxation in the absence of normal sensations usually associated with voiding. Overflow incontinence is an involuntary urine loss associated with overdistension of the bladder. Functional incontinence refers to those instances in which the function of the lower urinary tract is intact, but other factors (outside the urinary system) make it difficult or impossible for the patient to reach the toilet in time for voiding."

        "Question": "A patient being treated in the hospital has been experiencing occasional urinary retention. What nursing action should the nurse take to encourage a patient who is having difficulty voiding?",
        "Choice 1": "Use a slipper bedpan.",
        "Choice 2": "Apply a cold compress to the perineum.",
        "Choice 3": "Have the patient lie in a supine position.",
        "Choice 4": "Provide privacy for the patient.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nNursing measures to encourage normal voiding patterns include providing privacy, ensuring an environment and body position conducive to voiding, and assisting the patient with the use of the bathroom or bedside commode, rather than a bedpan, to provide a more natural setting for voiding. Most people find supine positioning not conducive to voiding."

        "Choice 1": "Diuretics should be promptly discontinued when an older adult experiences incontinence.",
        "Choice 2": "Restricting fluid intake is recommended for older adults experiencing incontinence.",
        "Choice 3": "Urinary catheterization is a first-line treatment for incontinence in older adults with incontinence.",
        "Choice 4": "Urinary incontinence is not considered a normal consequence of aging.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nNursing management is based on the premise that incontinence is not inevitable with illness or aging and that it is often reversible and treatable. Diuretics cannot always be safely discontinued. Fluid restriction and catheterization are not considered to be safe, first-line interventions for the treatment of incontinence."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nDullness on percussion of the suprapubic region is suggestive of urinary retention. Patients retaining urine are typically restless, not drowsy. A patient experiencing retention usually voids frequent, small amounts of urine and the use of beta-blockers is unrelated to urinary retention."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nFollowing ESWL, the nurse should strain the patient's urine for gravel or sand. There is no need to administer an IV bolus after the procedure and there is not a heightened risk of fluid overload. Catheter insertion is not normally indicated following ESWL."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIf voiding dysfunction goes undetected and untreated, the upper urinary system may become compromised. Chronic incomplete bladder emptying from poor detrusor pressure results in recurrent bladder infection. Incomplete bladder emptying due to bladder outlet obstruction, causing high-pressure detrusor contractions, can result in hydronephrosis from the high detrusor pressure that radiates up the ureters to the renal pelvis. This problem does not normally cause nephritic syndrome or pyelonephritis. Nephrotoxicity results from chemical causes."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nWhen indwelling catheters are used, the risk of UTI increases dramatically. Limiting their use significantly reduces an older adult's risk of developing a UTI. Regular toileting promotes continence, but has only an indirect effect on the risk of UTIs. Prophylactic antibiotics are not normally administered.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nYeast vaginitis occurs in as many as 25% of patients treated with antimicrobial agents that affect vaginal flora. Yeast vaginitis can cause more symptoms and be more difficult and costly to treat than the original UTI. Antibiotics do not affect menstrual periods and serial urine cultures are not normally necessary. Resistance is normally a result of failing to complete a prescribed course of antibiotics."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nMany medications affect urinary continence in addition to causing other unwanted or unexpected effects. Stress and dietary changes could potentially affect the patient's continence, but medications are more frequently causative of incontinence. UTIs can cause incontinence, but these infections do not result from contact with infected individuals."

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nResearch shows that written or verbal instruction alone is usually inadequate to teach an individual how to identify and strengthen the pelvic floor for sufficient bladder and bowel control. Biofeedback-assisted pelvic muscle exercise (PME) uses either electromyography or manometry to help the individual identify the pelvic muscles as he or she attempts to learn which muscle group is involved when performing PME. This objective assessment is likely superior to weekly contact with the patient. Surgery is not necessarily indicated if behavioral techniques are unsuccessful."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nImmediately after the indwelling catheter is removed, the patient is placed on a timed voiding schedule, usually every 2 to 3 hours. At the given time interval, the patient is instructed to void. The bladder is then scanned using a portable ultrasonic bladder scanner; if the bladder has not emptied completely, straight catheterization may be performed.

        "Choice 1": "Empty the collection bag when it is between one-half and two-thirds full.",
        "Choice 2": "Limit fluid intake to prevent production of large volumes of dilute urine.",
        "Choice 3": "Reinforce the appliance with tape if small leaks are detected.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe patient is instructed to avoid moisturizing soaps and body washes when cleaning the area because they interfere with the adhesion of the pouch. To maintain skin integrity, a skin barrier or leaking pouch is never patched with tape to prevent accumulation of urine under the skin barrier or faceplate. Fluids should be encouraged, not limited, and the collection bag should not be allowed to become more than one-third full."

        "Choice 1": "Emphasize that the diversion is an integral part of successful cancer treatment.",
        "Choice 2": "Encourage the patient to speak openly and frankly about the diversion.",
        "Choice 3": "Allow the patient to initiate the process of providing care for the diversion.",
        "Choice 4": "Provide the patient with detailed written materials about the diversion at the time of discharge.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAllowing the patient to express concerns and anxious feelings can help with body image, especially in adjusting to the changes in toileting habits. The nurse may have to initiate dialogue about the management of the diversion, especially if the patient is hesitant. Provision of educational materials is rarely sufficient to address a sudden change and profound change in body image. Emphasizing the role of the diversion in cancer treatment does not directly address the patient's body image."

Progesterone is the most important hormone for conditioning the endometrium in preparation for implantation of the fertilized ovum. Androgens, secreted by the ovaries in small amounts, are involved in the early development of the follicle and affect the female libido.

        "Type": "Single",

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAsking about abuse directly is effective in identifying the presence of abuse and should be included in the health history of all women. Oblique questions that relate to the character of the relationship or conflict resolution are less useful clinically. Asking about making a partner angry is not an appropriate way to screen for family violence because it does not directly address the problem."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "A,B,E",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nMenstrual history addresses such factors as the length of cycles, duration and amount of flow, presence of cramps or pain, and bleeding between periods or after intercourse.

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAlthough further assessment is undoubtedly necessary, it is likely that the couple will be experiencing hopelessness at the news that a potentially promising intervention has failed. Acute confusion denotes a cognitive deficit, not a sense of despair. Sadness at this news is not necessarily suggestive of impaired coping. Moral distress is unlikely because this is not a situation involving morality."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nGamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT), a variation of IVF, is the treatment of choice for patients with ovarian failure. In intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), an ovum is retrieved as described previously, and a single sperm is injected through the zona pellucida, through the egg membrane, and into the cytoplasm of the oocyte. The fertilized egg is then transferred back to the donor. ICSI is the treatment of choice in severe male factor infertility. IVF involves ovarian stimulation, egg retrieval, fertilization, and embryo transfer. Artificial insemination is the deposit of semen into the female genital tract by artificial means."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nSitting in a chair would not be recommended immediately in the postoperative period. This would place too much tension on the incision site. A low Fowler's position or, occasionally, a pillow placed under the knees, will reduce pain by relieving tension on the incision. Application of compression stocking would prevent a deep vein thrombosis from occurring. A low-residue diet would be ordered to prevent straining on defecation and wound contamination."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "A,B",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPatients with PID need to take action to avoid infecting others. Antibiotics are frequently required. Pregnancy does not necessarily need to be avoided, but there is a heightened risk of ectopic pregnancy. Weight loss does not directly alleviate symptoms. Regular follow-up is necessary, but Pap smears do not need to be performed every 3 months."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nBecause patients may be reluctant to discuss risk-taking behavior, routine screening should be offered to all women between the ages of 13 to 64 years in all health care settings. Assuring a woman that the offer of testing is not related to a heightened risk may alleviate her anxiety. Middle-aged women are not the prime demographic for HIV infection.

Information that sexual satisfaction and orgasm arise from clitoral stimulation rather than from the uterus reassures many women. Most women note some change in sexual feelings after hysterectomy, but they vary in intensity. In some cases, the vagina is shortened by surgery, and this may affect sensitivity or comfort. It would be inappropriate to reassure the patient that she will still be able to have children; there is no reason to reassure the patient about not being able to have sex.

        "Choice 1": "Analgesia should be withheld unless the patient's pain becomes unbearable.",
        "Choice 2": "Scheduled analgesia should be administered around-the-clock to prevent pain.",
        "Choice 3": "All analgesics should be given on a PRN, rather than scheduled, basis.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nBecause of the wide excision, the patient may experience severe pain and discomfort even with minimal movement. Therefore, analgesic agents are administered preventively (i.e., around the clock at designated times) to relieve pain, increase the patient's comfort level, and allow mobility. Opioids are usually required."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nA procedure called a radical trachelectomy is an alternative to hysterectomy in women with invasive cervical cancer who are young and want to have children. In this procedure, the cervix is gripped with retractors and pulled down into the vagina until it is visible. The affected tissue is excised while the rest of the cervix and uterus remain intact. A drawstring suture is used to close the cervix. For a woman who wants to have children, a radical hysterectomy would not provide the option of children. A radical culposcopy and a radical trabeculectomy are simple distracters for this question."

During pregnancy, early visits to the primary provider permit early detection of problems. During the postpartum period, the woman can be taught to perform pelvic muscle exercises, commonly known as Kegel exercises, to increase muscle mass and strengthen the muscles that support the uterus and then to continue them as a preventive action.

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIt would be most important for the nurse to palpate the breast to determine the presence of a mass and to refer the patient to her primary care provider. Edema and pitting of the skin may result from a neoplasm blocking lymphatic drainage, giving the skin an orange-peel appearance (peau d'orange), a classic sign of advanced breast cancer.

What is the nurse's best response?",
        "Choice 1": "“It helps to spread out the fat that makes up your breast.”",

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPaget's disease presents with erythema of the nipple and areola. Peau d'orange, which is associated with breast cancer, is caused by interference with lymphatic drainage, but does not cause these specific signs. Nipple inversion is considered normal if long-standing; if it is associated with fibrosis and is a recent development, malignancy is suspected.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nTreatment for breast cancer depends on the disease stage and type, the patient's age and menopausal status, and the disfiguring effects of the surgery. For this patient, lumpectomy is the most likely option because the nodule is well-defined. The patient usually undergoes radiation therapy afterward.

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nInstructions about BSE should be provided to men if they have a family history of breast cancer, because they may have an increased risk of male breast cancer. It is not within the scope of the practice of a nurse to refer a patient for a mammogram or to a surgeon; these actions are not necessary or recommended.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nCurrent practice emphasizes the importance of breast self-awareness, which is a woman's attentiveness to the normal appearance and feel of her breasts. BSE does not need to be synchronized with the performance of mammograms. Rapport between the patient and the care provider is beneficial, but does not necessarily determine the effectiveness of BSE.

When the nurse is providing preoperative education, the patient asks why an incisional biopsy is being done instead of just removing the mass. What would be the nurse's best response?",
        "Choice 1": "“An incisional biopsy is performed because it's known to be less painful and more accurate than other forms of testing.”",
        "Choice 2": "“An incisional biopsy is performed to confirm a diagnosis and so that special studies can be done that will help determine the best treatment.”",

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIncisional biopsy surgically removes a portion of a mass. This is performed to confirm a diagnosis and to conduct special studies that will aid in determining treatment. Incisional biopsies cannot always remove the whole mass, nor is it always beneficial to the patient to do so. The procedure is not chosen because of the potential for pain, the possibility of recovery from mastectomy, or the patient's age."

        "Question": "A 22-year-old male is being discharged home after surgery for testicular cancer. The patient is scheduled to begin chemotherapy in 2 weeks.  The patient tells the nurse that he doesn't think he can take weeks or months of chemotherapy, stating that he has researched the adverse effects online. What is the most appropriate nursing action for this patient at this time?",
        "Choice 1": "Provide empathy and encouragement in an effort to foster a positive outlook.",
        "Choice 2": "Tell the patient it is his decision whether to accept or reject chemotherapy.",
        "Choice 3": "Report the patient's statement to members of his support system.",
        "Choice 4": "Refer the patient to social work.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPatients may be required to endure a long course of therapy and will need encouragement to maintain a positive attitude.  It is certainly the patient's ultimate decision to accept or reject chemotherapy, but the nurse should focus on promoting a positive outlook. It would be a violation of confidentiality to report the patient's statement to members of his support system and there is no obvious need for a social work referral."

        "Answer": "B,C",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nApplying ice bags intermittently to the scrotum for several hours after surgery can reduce swelling and relieve discomfort, and is preferable to the application of heat. The nurse advises the patient to wear snug, cotton underwear or a scrotal support for added comfort and support. Sitz baths can also enhance comfort. Extended bed rest is unnecessary, and sexual activity can usually be resumed in 1 week."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAdministering a medication that relaxes smooth muscles can help relieve bladder spasms. Neither a cold compress nor catheter irrigation will alleviate bladder spasms.

She describes herself as being “anxious and pretty depressed.” What principle of stress and adaptation should be integrated into the nurse's plan of care for this patient?",
        "Choice 1": "Adaptation often fails during stressful events and results in homeostasis.",
        "Choice 2": "Stress is a part of all lives, and, eventually, this young woman will adapt.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nFour concepts—constancy, homeostasis, stress, and adaptation—are key to the understanding of steady state. Homeostasis is maintained through emotional, neurologic, and hormonal measures; stressors create pressure for adaptation. Sometimes too many stressors disrupt homeostasis, and, if adaptation fails, the result is disease. If a person is overwhelmed by stress, he or she may never adapt.

        "Choice 1": "Coping is a physiologic measure used to deal with change, and he will physically adapt.",
        "Choice 2": "Coping is composed of the physiologic and psychological processes that people use to adapt to change.",
        "Choice 3": "Coping is the human need for faith and hope, both of which create change.",

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIndicators of stress and the stress response include both subjective and objective measures. They are psychological, physiologic, or behavioral and reflect social behaviors and thought processes. The physiologic and psychological processes that people use to adapt to stress are the essence of the coping process. Coping is both a physiologic and psychological process used to adapt to change.

His heart rate increases, his eyes dilate, and his blood pressure increases. The nurse recognizes these changes as being attributable to what response?",
        "Choice 1": "Part of the limbic system response",
        "Choice 2": "Sympathetic nervous response",
        "Choice 3": "Hypothalamic-pituitary response",
        "Choice 4": "Local adaptation syndrome",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe sympathetic nervous system responds rapidly to stress; norepinephrine is released at nerve ending causing the organs to respond (i.e., heart rate increases, eyes dilate, and blood pressure increases). The limbic system is a mediator of emotions and behavior that are critical to survival during times of stress. The hypothalamic-pituitary response regulates the cortisol-induced metabolic effect that results in elevated blood sugars during stressful situations. Local adaptation syndrome is a tissue-specific inflammatory reaction."

        "Question": "You are the nurse caring for a 72-year-old woman who is recovering from a hemicolectomy on the postsurgical unit. The surgery was very stressful and prolonged, and you note on the chart that her blood sugars are elevated, yet diabetes does not appear in her previous medical history. To what do you attribute this elevation in blood sugars?",
        "Choice 1": "It is a temporary result of increased secretion of antidiuretic hormone.",
        "Choice 2": "She must have had diabetes prior to surgery that was undiagnosed.",
        "Choice 3": "She has suffered pancreatic trauma during her abdominal surgery.",
        "Choice 4": "The blood sugars are probably a result of the “fight-or-flight” reaction.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nDuring stressful situations, ACTH stimulates the release of cortisol from the adrenal gland, which creates protein catabolism releasing amino acids and stimulating the liver to convert amino acids to glucose; the result is elevated blood sugars. Antidiuretic hormone is released during stressful situations and stimulates reabsorption of water in the distal and collecting tubules of the kidney. Assuming the patient had diabetes prior to surgery demonstrates a lack of understanding of stress-induced hyperglycemia. No evidence presented in the question other than elevated blood sugars would support a diagnosis of diabetes."

The nurse rechecks her blood pressure about 10 minutes later and it is normal. The patient asks the nurse if she should be concerned that she may have hypertension. What statement should guide the nurse's response?",
        "Choice 1": "She should not worry; it was stress related and her regular blood pressure is good.",
        "Choice 2": "The first blood pressure was part of a simple stress response; our long-term blood pressure is controlled by negative feedback systems.",
        "Choice 3": "Blood pressure is only one measure of hypertension; she should review this with the doctor and plan to recheck it on a regular basis.",
        "Choice 4": "The respiratory infection is the probably the cause of the elevated blood pressure, and, with treatment, her blood pressure should remain normal.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nA simple stress response will temporarily elevate a blood pressure and heart rate. Long-term blood pressure response is controlled by negative feedback systems.\r\nFor a science teacher, this would be an appropriate level of teaching/learning and would serve to promote health. The nurse would be incorrect in assuming the patient's blood pressure is good based on only two blood pressure readings. The stress of a respiratory infection could account for the elevated blood pressure, but assuring the patient that, with treatment, her blood pressure will return to normal may not be true."

        "Choice 1": "Hyperplasia is the abnormal decrease in cell and organ size and is a precursor to cancer.",
        "Choice 2": "Hyperplasia is an abnormal increase in new cells and is reversible with the stimulus for cell growth removed.",
        "Choice 3": "Hyperplasia is the change in appearance of the thyroid due to a chronic irritation and will reverse with the stimulus removed.",
        "Choice 4": "Hyperplasia is a cancerous growth and will be removed surgically.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nHyperplasia is an increase in the number of new cells in an organ or tissue. This is due to increased mitotic stimulation from the additional cell division, and this, in turn, enlarges the tissue. Hyperplasia is reversible when the stimulus for cell growth is removed. Hyperplasia is the increase in the number of new cells, not a change in size or appearance. Hyperplasia is the increase in the number of new cells, which may or may not be cancerous growth."

The mother explains to the nurse, “It hurts him so bad and it looks swollen, red, and infected.” What can the triage nurse teach the mother?",
        "Choice 1": "The pain, redness, and swelling are part of the inflammatory process, but it is probably too early for an infection.",
        "Choice 2": "Bee stings frequently cause infection, pain, and swelling, and, with treatment, the infection should begin to subside late today.",
        "Choice 3": "The infection was probably caused by the stinger, which may still be in the wound.",
        "Choice 4": "The mother's assessment is accurate and the ED doctor will probably prescribe antibiotics to fix the problem.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nCells or tissues of the body may be injured or killed by any agent (physical, chemical, infectious). When this happens, an inflammatory response (or inflammation) naturally occurs in the healthy tissues adjacent to the injury site. Inflammation is not the same as infection. An infectious agent is only one of several agents that may trigger an inflammatory response. Although bee stings may cause infection, the signs and symptoms (very painful, looks swollen and red) result from the acute inflammatory response.

        "Choice 1": "This is a benign process that occurs as lung tissue regenerates.",
        "Choice 2": "Dysplastic cells have a high potential to become malignant.",
        "Choice 3": "This process involves a rapid increase in number of cells.",
        "Choice 4": "Dysplasia may cause uncontrolled growth of scar tissue.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nDysplasia is bizarre cell growth resulting in cells that differ in size, shape, or arrangement from other cells of the same tissue type. Dysplastic cells have a tendency to become malignant; dysplasia is seen commonly in epithelial cells in the bronchi of people who smoke. This may not be a harmless condition and dysplasia does not cause scar tissue. Hyperplasia is an increase in the number of new cells."

Changes to diet and activity may be beneficial, but social interaction is known to be of particular benefit. Attendance at a wellness clinic may or may not be beneficial, and does not involve social interaction."

You expect that the patient now has an increase in blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate. You spend time talking with this patient and his vital signs become closer to normal range. To what would you attribute this phenomenon?",
        "Choice 1": "Cortisol levels are decreasing.",

        "Choice 3": "The patient is adapting to noxious stressors.",
        "Choice 4": "The sympathetic response has been activated.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nSelye developed a theory of adaptation to biologic stress that he named the general adaptation syndrome (GAS), which has three phases: alarm, resistance, and exhaustion. During the alarm phase, the sympathetic “fight-or-flight” response is activated with release of catecholamines and the onset of the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) – adrenal cortical response. The alarm reaction is defensive and anti-inflammatory but self-limited. Because living in a continuous state of alarm would result in death, people move into the second stage, resistance. During the resistance stage, adaptation to the noxious stressor occurs, and cortisol activity is still increased. If exposure to the stressor is prolonged, the third stage, exhaustion, occurs. During the exhaustion stage, endocrine activity increases, and this has negative effects on the body systems (especially the circulatory, digestive, and immune systems) that can lead to death."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe appraisal process contributes to the development of an emotion. Negative emotions, such as fear and anger, accompany harm/loss appraisals, and positive emotions accompany challenge. Harm and challenge are not feelings, so the corresponding options are incorrect.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nWhen a person endures prolonged or unrelenting suffering, the outcome is frequently the development of a stress-related illness. Physical illness is not always caused by prolonged stress. The elderly population is not the only population at increased risk for hypertension due to stress. Stress does not always exacerbate the physiologic processes of the elderly. This is an absolute statement, and true absolutes are rare."

During this process, general, nonspecific symptoms develop, including malaise, loss of appetite, aching, and weakness. The fact that the patient is experiencing systemic effects such as lethargy, malaise, aching, weakness, and loss of appetite suggests that inflammation is not limited to one specific site."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nRegardless of the cause, a general sequence of events occurs in the local inflammatory response. This sequence involves changes in the microcirculation, including vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and leukocytic cellular infiltration. As these changes take place, five cardinal signs of inflammation are produced: redness, heat, swelling, pain, and loss of function. Infections do not always resolve spontaneously.

During childhood, too few encounters with stress occur to promote the development of adaptive functioning, and children are vulnerable. During adulthood, a number of stressful events occur, and people develop resistance or adaptation.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe process of facial reconstruction is often slow and tedious. Because a person's facial appearance affects self-esteem so greatly, this type of reconstruction is often a very emotional experience for the patient. Reinforcement of the patient's successful coping strategies improves self-esteem.  If prosthetic devices are used, the patient is taught how to use and care for them to gain a sense of greater independence.

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nBoth the donor site and the grafted area must be protected from exposure to extremes in temperature, external trauma, and sunlight because these areas are sensitive, especially to thermal injuries. Antibiotic ointments are not typically prescribed and massage may damage these fragile sites. There is no need to protect the sites from all forms of moisture for the long term."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAsymmetric rheumatoid factor–negative arthritis of multiple joints occurs in up to 30% of people with psoriasis, most typically after the skin lesions appear. The most typical joints affected include those in the hands or feet, although sometimes larger joints such as the elbow, knees, or hips may be affected. As such, the nurse should assess for this musculoskeletal complication. GI, cardiovascular, and neurologic function are not affected by psoriasis."

        "Question": "A patient is brought to the emergency department from the site of a chemical fire, where he suffered a burn that involves the epidermis, dermis, and the muscle and bone of the right arm. On inspection, the skin appears charred. Based on these assessment findings, what is the depth of the burn on the patient's arm?",
        "Choice 1": "Superficial partial-thickness",
        "Choice 2": "Deep partial-thickness",
        "Choice 3": "Full partial-thickness",
        "Choice 4": "Full-thickness",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nA full-thickness burn involves total destruction of the epidermis and dermis and, in some cases, underlying tissue as well. Wound color ranges widely from white to red, brown, or black. The burned area is painless because the nerve fibers are destroyed. The wound can appear leathery; hair follicles and sweat glands are destroyed. Edema may also be present. Superficial partial-thickness burns involve the epidermis and possibly a portion of the dermis; the patient will experience pain that is soothed by cooling. Deep partial-thickness burns involve the epidermis, upper dermis, and portion of the deeper dermis; the patient will complain of pain and sensitivity to cold air. Full partial thickness is not a depth of burn.",

        "Question": "The current phase of a patient's treatment for a burn injury prioritizes wound care, nutritional support, and prevention of complications such as infection. Based on these care priorities, the patient is in what phase of burn care?",
        "Choice 1": "Emergent",
        "Choice 2": "Immediate resuscitative",
        "Choice 3": "Acute",
        "Choice 4": "Rehabilitation",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe acute or intermediate phase of burn care follows the emergent/resuscitative phase and begins 48 to 72 hours after the burn injury. During this phase, attention is directed toward continued assessment and maintenance of respiratory and circulatory status, fluid and electrolyte balance, and gastrointestinal function. Infection prevention, burn wound care (i.e., wound cleaning, topical antibacterial therapy, wound dressing, dressing changes, wound débridement, and wound grafting), pain management, and nutritional support are priorities at this stage. Priorities during the emergent or immediate resuscitative phase include first aid, prevention of shock and respiratory distress, detection and treatment of concomitant injuries, and initial wound assessment and care. The priorities during the rehabilitation phase include prevention of scars and contractures, rehabilitation, functional and cosmetic reconstruction, and psychosocial counseling."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nOnce the burn has been sustained, the application of cool water is the best first-aid measure. Soaking the burn area intermittently in cool water or applying cool towels gives immediate and striking relief from pain, and limits local tissue edema and damage. However, never apply ice directly to the burn, never wrap the person in ice, and never use cold soaks or dressings for longer than several minutes; such procedures may worsen the tissue damage and lead to hypothermia in people with large burns.

        "Choice 4": "Administration of stool softeners",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIf the intestinal mucosa receives some type of protection against permeability change, infection could be avoided. Early enteral feeding is one step to help avoid this increased intestinal permeability and prevent early endotoxin translocation. Antibiotics are seldom prescribed prophylactically because of the risk of promoting resistant strains of bacteria. A bowel cleansing procedure would not be ordered for this patient. The administration of stool softeners would not assist in avoiding increased intestinal permeability and prevent early endotoxin translocation."

        "Choice 4": "Early closure of the wound",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nMechanical débridementcan be achieved through the use of surgical scissors, scalpels, or forceps to remove the eschar until the point of pain and bleeding occurs. Mechanical débridement can also be accomplished through the use of topical enzymatic débridement agents. The spontaneous separation of dead tissue from the viable tissue is an example of natural débridement. Shaving the burned skin layers and early wound closure are examples of surgical débridement."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPathophysiologic changes resulting from major burns during the initial burn-shock period include massive fluid losses. Addressing these losses is a major priority in the initial phase of treatment. Antibiotics and PRBCs are not normally administered. Potassium chloride would exacerbate the patient's hyperkalemia."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nFluid resuscitation with lactated Ringers (LR) should be initiated using the American Burn Association's (ABA) fluid resuscitation formulas. LR is the crystalloid of choice because its composition and osmolality most closely resemble plasma and because use of normal saline is associated with hyperchloremic acidosis. Potassium chloride solutions would exacerbate the hyperkalemia that occurs following burn injuries."

The patient has burns to the groin area and circumferential burns to both upper thighs. When assessing the patient's legs distal to the wound site, the nurse should be cognizant of the risk of what complication?",

        "Choice 4": "Venous thromboembolism (VTE)",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAs edema increases, pressure on small blood vessels and nerves in the distal extremities causes an obstruction of blood flow and consequent ischemia. This complication is similar to compartment syndrome. Referred pain, cellulitis, and VTE are not noted complications that occur distal to the injury site."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAs capillaries regain integrity, 48 or more hours after the burn, fluid moves from the interstitial to the intravascular compartment and diuresis begins. This is an expected development and does not require a reduction in the IV infusion rate or the administration of NaCl. Diuresis is not suggestive of AKI."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe goal of treatment is to provide a long-acting analgesic that will provide even coverage for this long-term discomfort. It is helpful to use escalating doses when initiating the medication to reach the level of pain control that is acceptable to the patient. The use of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) gives control to the patient and achieves this goal. Patients cannot normally achieve adequate pain control without the use of opioids, and parenteral administration is usually required."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe use of an ocular prosthesis is likely to have a significant impact on a patient's body image. Prostheses are not associated with chronic pain or ineffective protection. The patient experiences a change in vision, but is usually able to accommodate such changes and prevent unilateral neglect."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPilocarpine, a miotic drug used to treat glaucoma, achieves its effect by constricting the pupil. Blurred vision lasting 1 to 2 hours after instilling the eye drops is an expected adverse effect. The patient may also note difficulty adapting to the dark. Because blurred vision is an expected adverse effect, the drug does not need to be withheld, nor does the physician need to be notified. Likewise, the patient does not need to be treated for an allergic reaction. Wearing glasses will not alter this temporary adverse effect."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nFor pneumatic retinopexy, postoperative positioning of the patient is critical because the injected bubble must float into a position overlying the area of detachment, providing consistent pressure to reattach the sensory retina. The patient must maintain a prone position that would allow the gas bubble to act as a tamponade for the retinal break. Patients and family members should be made aware of these special needs beforehand so that the patient can be made as comfortable as possible. It would be inappropriate to deviate from this order and there is no obvious need to confirm the order."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nMost patients are not allowed to take topical anesthetics home because of the risk of overuse. Patients with corneal abrasions and erosions experience severe pain and are often tempted to overuse topical anesthetic eye drops. Overuse of these drops results in softening of the cornea. Prolonged use of anesthetic drops can delay wound healing and can lead to permanent corneal opacification and scarring, resulting in visual loss.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe nurse should empathically promote the patient's coping with her loss. Focusing on the remaining senses could easily be interpreted as downplaying the patient's loss, and recovery is not normally a realistic possibility. Even with successful adaptation, the patient's lifestyle will be profoundly affected."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAbsorption of eye drops by the nasolacrimal duct is undesirable because of the potential systemic side effects of ocular medications. To diminish systemic absorption and minimize the side effects, it is important to occlude the puncta. Self-administration, supine positioning, and adequate hydration do not prevent this adverse effect."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPain when the nurse pulls gently on the auricle in preparation for an otoscopic examination of the ear canal is a characteristic finding in patients with otitis externa. Tophi are deposits of generally painless uric acid crystals; they are a common physical assessment finding in patients diagnosed with gout. Cerumen is a normal finding during assessment of the ear canal. Its presence does not necessarily indicate that inflammation is present.

        "Choice 4": "Previous perforation of the eardrum",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nLong-term, regular use of quinine for management of leg cramps is associated with loss of hearing acuity. Radiation therapy for cancer should not affect hearing; however, hearing can be significantly compromised by chemotherapy. Allergy to hair products may be associated with otitis externa; however, it is not linked to hearing loss. An ear drum that perforates spontaneously due to the sudden drop in altitude associated with a high dive usually heals well and is not likely to become infected. Recurrent otitis media with perforation can affect hearing as a result of chronic inflammation of the ossicles in the middle ear."

        "Choice 4": "Raise the voice to project sound at a higher frequency.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nCommunication with the hearing impaired can be facilitated by talking in a quiet space free of competing noise stimuli and other distractions. Asking the patient to repeat what was said is likely to provoke frustration in the patient. A more effective strategy would be to repeat the question or statement, choosing different words. Raising the voice to project sound at higher frequency would make understanding more difficult. The nurse cannot assume that the patient reads lips. If the patient does read lips, on average he or she will understand only 50% of words accurately."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nFor the patient experiencing acute head trauma, immediately report the presence of clear, watery drainage from the ear. The fluid is likely to be cerebrospinal fluid associated with skull fracture. The ability to visualize the malleus is a normal physical assessment finding. The tympanic membrane is normally pearly gray in color. Tenderness of the mastoid area usually indicates inflammation. This should be reported, but is not a finding indicating urgent intervention."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAn appropriate nursing intervention would include loosening any restrictive clothing on the patient. No attempt should be made to restrain the patient during the seizure because muscular contractions are strong and restraint can produce injury. Do not attempt to pry open jaws that are clenched in a spasm to insert anything. Broken teeth and injury to the lips and tongue may result from such an action. If possible, place the patient on one side with head flexed forward, which allows the tongue to fall forward and facilitates drainage of saliva and mucus."

        "Question": "The nurse is providing care for a patient who is withdrawing from heavy alcohol use. The nurse and other members of the care team are present at the bedside when the patient has a seizure. In preparation for documenting this clinical event, the nurse should note which of the following?",
        "Choice 1": "The ability of the patient to follow instructions during the seizure.",
        "Choice 2": "The success or failure of the care team to physically restrain the patient.",
        "Choice 3": "The patient's ability to explain his seizure during the postictal period.",
        "Choice 4": "The patient's activities immediately prior to the seizure.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nBefore and during a seizure, the nurse observes the circumstances before the seizure, including visual, auditory, or olfactory stimuli; tactile stimuli; emotional or psychological disturbances; sleep; and hyperventilation. Communication with the patient is not possible during a seizure and physical restraint is not attempted. The patient's ability to explain the seizure is not clinically relevant."

        "Choice 2": "Assessing the patient's ability to follow complex commands",
        "Choice 3": "Assessing the patient's judgment",
        "Choice 4": "Assessing the patient's response to pain",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAssessment of the patient with an altered LOC often starts with assessing the verbal response through determining the patient's orientation to time, person, and place. In most cases, this assessment will precede each of the other listed assessments, even though each may be indicated."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIf a brain tumor is the cause of the increased ICP, corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone) help reduce the edema surrounding the tumor. Solumedrol, a steroid, and furosemide, a loop diuretic, are not the drugs of choice in this instance. Dextromethorphan is used in cough medicines."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nGeneralized seizures often involve both hemispheres of the brain, causing both sides of the body to react. Intense rigidity of the entire body may occur, followed by alternating muscle relaxation and contraction (generalized tonic–clonic contraction). This pattern of rigidity does not occur in patients who experience unclassified, absence, or focal seizures."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "A,B,C",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPreoperative diagnostic procedures may include a CT scan to demonstrate the lesion and show the degree of surrounding brain edema, the ventricular size, and the displacement. An MRI scan provides information similar to that of a CT scan with improved tissue contrast, resolution, and anatomic definition. Cerebral angiography may be used to study a tumor's blood supply or to obtain information about vascular lesions. Transcranial Doppler flow studies are used to evaluate the blood flow within intracranial blood vessels. Regular x-rays of the skull would not be diagnostic for an intracranial mass. An EMG would not be ordered prior to intracranial surgery to remove a mass."

        "Choice 1": "Administer morphine sulfate as ordered.",
        "Choice 2": "Reposition the patient in a prone position.",
        "Choice 3": "Apply a hot pack to the patient's scalp.",
        "Choice 4": "Implement distraction techniques.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe patient usually has a headache after a craniotomy as a result of stretching and irritation of nerves in the scalp during surgery. Morphine sulfate may also be used in the management of postoperative pain in patients who have undergone a craniotomy. Prone positioning is contraindicated due to the consequent increase in ICP. Distraction would likely be inadequate to reduce pain and a hot pack may cause vasodilation and increased pain."

        "Choice 4": "Recognize the need to refer the patient to the palliative care team.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nSome degree of cerebral edema occurs after brain surgery; it tends to peak 24 to 36 hours after surgery, producing decreased responsiveness on the second postoperative day. As such, there is not necessarily any need to deem the surgery unsuccessful or to refer the patient to palliative care. A decrease in LOC is not evidence of an intracranial hemorrhage."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe underlying cause of a seizure is an electrical disturbance (dysrhythmia) in the nerve cells in one section of the brain; these cells emit abnormal, recurring, uncontrolled electrical discharges. Seizures are not caused by changes in blood flow or electrolytes."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nTo prevent shoulder pain, the nurse should never lift a patient by the flaccid shoulder or pull on the affected arm or shoulder. The patient is taught how to move and exercise the affected arm/shoulder through proper movement and positioning. The patient is instructed to interlace the fingers, place the palms together, and push the clasped hands slowly forward to bring the scapulae forward; he or she then raises both hands above the head. This is repeated throughout the day. The use of a properly worn sling when the patient is out of bed prevents the paralyzed upper extremity from dangling without support. Range-of-motion exercises are still vitally important in preventing a frozen shoulder and ultimately atrophy of subcutaneous tissues, which can cause more pain. Elevation of the arm and hand is also important in preventing dependent edema of the hand."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe inability to talk on the telephone or answer a question or exclusion from conversation causes anger, frustration, fear of the future, and hopelessness. A common pitfall is for the nurse or other health care team member to complete the thoughts or sentences of the patient. This should be avoided because it may cause the patient to feel more frustrated at not being allowed to speak and may deter efforts to practice putting thoughts together and completing a sentence. The patient may also benefit from a communication board, which has pictures of commonly requested needs and phrases. The board may be translated into several languages."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIf possible, the patient is placed in a prone position for 15 to 30 minutes several times a day. A small pillow or a support is placed under the pelvis, extending from the level of the umbilicus to the upper third of the thigh. This helps to promote hyperextension of the hip joints, which is essential for normal gait, and helps prevent knee and hip flexion contractures. The hip joints should not be maintained in flexion and the Trendelenberg position is not indicated."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nCerebral aneurysm precautions are implemented for the patient with a diagnosis of aneurysm to provide a nonstimulating environment, prevent increases in ICP, and prevent further bleeding. The patient is placed on immediate and absolute bed rest in a quiet, nonstressful environment because activity, pain, and anxiety elevate BP, which increases the risk for bleeding. Visitors, except for family, are restricted. The head of the bed is elevated 15 to 30 degrees to promote venous drainage and decrease ICP. Some neurologists, however, prefer that the patient remains flat to increase cerebral perfusion. No enemas are permitted, but stool softeners and mild laxatives are prescribed. Thigh-high elastic compression stockings or sequential compression boots may be ordered to decrease the patient's risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT)."

Patient and family teaching includes information about the causes of hemorrhagic stroke and its possible consequences. Symptoms of hydrocephalus include gradual onset of drowsiness and behavioral changes.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe patient with homonymous hemianopsia (loss of half of the visual field) turns away from the affected side of the body and tends to neglect that side and the space on that side; this is called amorphosynthesis. In such instances, the patient cannot see food on half of the tray, and only half of the room is visible. It is important for the nurse to remind the patient constantly of the other side of the body, to maintain alignment of the extremities, and if possible, to place the extremities where the patient can see them. Patients with a decreased field of vision should be approached on the side where visual perception is intact. All visual stimuli (clock, calendar, and television) should be placed on this side. The patient can be taught to turn the head in the direction of the defective visual field to compensate for this loss. Increasing the natural or artificial lighting in the room and providing eyeglasses are important in increasing vision. There is no reason to keep the lights dim."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe ischemic cascade begins when cerebral blood flow decreases to less than 25 mL per 100 g of blood per minute. At this point, neurons are no longer able to maintain aerobic respiration. The mitochondria must then switch to anaerobic respiration, which generates large amounts of lactic acid, causing a change in the pH. This switch to the less efficient anaerobic respiration also renders the neuron incapable of producing sufficient quantities of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to fuel the depolarization processes. The membrane pumps that maintain electrolyte balances begin to fail, and the cells cease to function."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nSigns of increasing ICP include slowing of the heart rate (bradycardia), increasing systolic BP, and widening pulse pressure. As brain compression increases, respirations become rapid, BP may decrease, and the pulse slows further. A rapid rise in body temperature is regarded as unfavorable.

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAn epidural hematoma is considered an extreme emergency. Marked neurologic deficit or respiratory arrest can occur within minutes. Treatment consists of making an opening through the skull to decrease ICP emergently, remove the clot, and control the bleeding.  Antihypertensive medications would not be a priority. Anticoagulant therapy should not be ordered for a patient who has a cranial bleed. This could further increase bleeding activity.  Insertion of an intracranial monitoring device may be done during the surgery, but is not priority for this patient."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIt is important to promote venous return to the heart and prevent venous stasis in a patient with altered mobility. Applying elastic stockings will aid in the prevention of a DVT.  The patient should not be placed on fluid restriction because a dehydrated state will increase the risk of clotting throughout the body.  Antifibrinolytic agents cause the blood to clot, which is absolutely contraindicated in this situation. PROM exercises are not an effective protection against the development of DVT."

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIf the patient with a brain injury is very agitated, benzodiazepines are the most commonly used sedatives and do not affect cerebral blood flow or ICP. The HOB should be elevated 30 degrees. Suctioning should be done a limited basis, due to increasing the pressure in the cranium. The Valsalva maneuver is to be avoided.

        "Question": "Following a spinal cord injury a patient is placed in halo traction. While performing pin site care, the nurse notes that one of the traction pins has become detached. The nurse would be correct in implementing what priority nursing action?",
        "Choice 1": "Complete the pin site care to decrease risk of infection.",
        "Choice 2": "Notify the neurosurgeon of the occurrence.",
        "Choice 3": "Stabilize the head in a lateral position.",
        "Choice 4": "Reattach the pin to prevent further head trauma.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIf one of the pins became detached, the head is stabilized in neutral position by one person while another notifies the neurosurgeon. Reattaching the pin as a nursing intervention would not be done due to risk of increased injury. Pin site care would not be a priority in this instance. Prevention of neurologic injury is the priority."

        "Choice 1": "Promoting adequate circulation",
        "Choice 2": "Treating the child's increased ICP",
        "Choice 3": "Assessing secondary brain injury",
        "Choice 4": "Preserving brain homeostasis",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAll therapy is directed toward preserving brain homeostasis and preventing secondary brain injury, which is injury to the brain that occurs after the original traumatic event. The scenario does not indicate the child has increased ICP or a secondary brain injury at this point. Promoting circulation is likely secondary to the broader goal of preserving brain homeostasis."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nCT and MRI scans, the primary neuroimaging diagnostic tools, are useful in evaluating the brain structure. Ultrasound would not show the brain nor would an x-ray. A PET scan shows brain function, not brain structure."

        "Question": "A 13-year-old was brought to the ED, unconscious, after being hit in the head by a baseball. When the child regains consciousness, 5 hours after being admitted, he cannot remember the traumatic event. MRI shows no structural sign of injury. What injury would the nurse suspect the patient has?",
        "Choice 1": "Diffuse axonal injury",
        "Choice 2": "Grade 1 concussion with frontal lobe involvement",
        "Choice 3": "Contusion",
        "Choice 4": "Grade 3 concussion with temporal lobe involvement",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIn a grade 3 concussion there is a loss of consciousness lasting from seconds to minutes. Temporal lobe involvement results in amnesia. Frontal lobe involvement can cause uncharacteristic behavior and a grade 1 concussion does not involve loss of consciousness. Diagnostic studies may show no apparent structural sign of injury, but the duration of unconsciousness is an indicator of the severity of the concussion. Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) results from widespread shearing and rotational forces that produce damage throughout the brain—to axons in the cerebral hemispheres, corpus callosum, and brain stem. In cerebral contusion, a moderate to severe head injury, the brain is bruised and damaged in a specific area because of severe acceleration-deceleration force or blunt trauma."

        "Choice 3": "Embolus",
        "Choice 4": "Stroke",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nTwo major factors place older adults at increased risk for hematomas. First, the dura becomes more adherent to the skull with increasing age. Second, many older adults take aspirin and anticoagulants as part of routine management of chronic conditions. Because of these factors, the patient's risk of a hematoma is likely greater than that of stroke, embolism, or skull fracture."

        "Choice 1": "When the patient's condition begins to deteriorate",
        "Choice 2": "As soon as the initial assessment is made",
        "Choice 3": "At the beginning of each shift",
        "Choice 4": "When there is a clinically significant change in the patient's condition",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nNeurologic parameters are assessed initially and as frequently as the patient's condition requires. As soon as the initial assessment is made, the use of a neurologic flowchart is started and maintained. A new chart is not begun at the start of every shift."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nTo allow the patient longer times of uninterrupted sleep and rest, the nurse can group nursing care activities so that the patient is disturbed less frequently. However, it is impractical and unsafe to provide no care for an 8-hour period. The use of benzodiazepines should be avoided."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nHelpful interventions to facilitate coping include providing family members with accurate and honest information and encouraging them to continue to set well-defined, short-term goals. Stating that a patient's condition could be worse downplays their concerns. Emphasizing the importance of acceptance may not necessarily help the family accept the patient's condition. Family members cannot normally plan a patient's hospital care, although they may contribute to the care in some ways."

        "Choice 4": "Assess the player's reflexes.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAt the scene of the injury, the patient must be immobilized on a spinal (back) board, with the head and neck maintained in a neutral position, to prevent an incomplete injury from becoming complete. This is a priority over determining the patient's vital signs. It would be inappropriate to test ROM or reflexes."

        "Choice 4": "Allow the patient to initiate repositioning.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nTo prevent hypotensive episodes, close monitoring of vital signs before and during position changes is essential. Prolonged bed rest carries numerous risks and it is not possible to provide a bolus before each position change. Following the patient's lead may or may not help regulate BP."

In some cultures (e.g., Hispanic, Arab), male health care providers may be prohibited from touching or examining certain parts of the female body. Similarly, it may be inappropriate for females to care for males. In the Hispanic culture, grandmothers often care for pediatric patients; the female of the family is often held responsible for the family's health care and health care information.

The nurse decides that an appropriate nursing diagnosis is “anxiety related to lack of control over the health circumstances.” In establishing this plan of care for the patient, the nurse should include what intervention?",
        "Choice 1": "The patient will receive antianxiety medications every 4 hours.",
        "Choice 2": "The patient's family will be instructed on planning the patient's care.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nHandwashing is the major infection control measure to reduce the risk of transmission of MRSA and other nosocomial pathogens. No convincing evidence exists to support that bathing patients with antibacterial soap is effective. Culture surveys can help establish the true prevalence of MRSA in a facility, but are used only to help implement where and when infection-control measures are needed. Hand hygiene is known to be more clinically important than housekeeping."

        "Choice 1": "“There are promising treatments for MRSA, so this is no cause for serious concern.”",
        "Choice 2": "“This doesn't mean that you have an infection; it shows that the bacteria live on one of your skin surfaces.”",
        "Choice 3": "“The vast majority of patients in the hospital test positive for MRSA, but the infection doesn't normally cause serious symptoms.”",
        "Choice 4": "“This finding is only preliminary, and your doctor will likely order further testing.”",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",

        "Choice 3": "Development of a skin break",
        "Choice 4": "Persistent contact of the bacteria with skin surfaces",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nColonization can progress to infection if there is a portal of entry by which bacteria can invade body tissues. The use of vancomycin, or any other antibiotic, would not necessarily precipitate a VRE infection.  Prolonged skin contact is similarly unlikely to cause infection, provided the skin remains intact."

        "Choice 1": "“There are many drug-resistant strains of gonorrhea, so more than one antibiotic may be required for successful treatment.”",
        "Choice 2": "“The combination of these two antibiotics reduces the later risk of reinfection.”",
        "Choice 3": "“Many people infected with gonorrhea are infected with chlamydia as well.”",
        "Choice 4": "“This combination of medications will eradicate the infection twice as fast than a single antibiotic.”",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nBecause patients are often coinfected with both gonorrhea and chlamydia, the CDC recommends dual therapy even if only gonorrhea has been laboratory proven. Although the number of resistant strains of gonorrhea has increased, that is not the reason for use of combination antibiotic therapy. Dual therapy is prescribed to treat both gonorrhea and chlamydia, because many patients with gonorrhea have a coexisting chlamydial infection. This combination of antibiotics does not reduce the risk of reinfection or provide a faster cure."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nStandard precautions are used to prevent contamination from blood and body fluids. Gloves are worn whenever exposure is possible, and hands should be washed after removing gloves. Needles are never recapped after use because this increases the risk of accidental needlesticks. Under ordinary circumstances, masks and gowns are not necessary for starting an IV line. Double-gloving is not a recognized component of standard precautions."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe patient's privacy and sensitivity must be respected, because the patient will be experiencing a stress response to the assault. Pubic hair is combed or trimmed for sampling. Paper bags are used for evidence collection because plastic bags retain moisture, which promotes mold and mildew that can destroy evidence. Bathing the patient before the examination would destroy or remove key evidence."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nEstablishing if the patient has suicidal thoughts or intents helps identify the level of depression and intervention. Physical symptoms are relevant and should be explored. Allow the patient to express feelings, and conduct the interview at a comfortable pace for the patient.

        "Question": "The triage nurse is working in the ED. A homeless person is admitted during a blizzard with complaints of being unable to feel his feet and lower legs. Core temperature is noted at 33.2°C (91.8ºF). The patient is intoxicated with alcohol at the time of admission and is visibly malnourished. What is the triage nurse's priority in the care of this patient?",
        "Choice 1": "Addressing the patient's hypothermia",
        "Choice 2": "Addressing the patient's frostbite in his lower extremities",
        "Choice 3": "Addressing the patient's alcohol intoxication",
        "Choice 4": "Addressing the patient's malnutrition",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe patient may also have frostbite, but hypothermia takes precedence in treatment because it is systemic rather than localized. The alcohol abuse and the alteration in nutrition do not take precedence over the treatment of hypothermia because both problems are a less acute threat to the patient's survival."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe goals of management are to provide support, to reduce the patient's emotional trauma, and to gather available evidence for possible legal proceedings. All of the interventions are aimed at encouraging the patient to gain a sense of control over his or her life. The patient's well-being should be considered a priority over criminal proceedings.

        "Choice 1": "The mother also has genetic mutation of chromosome 21.",
        "Choice 2": "The patient has a nondisjunction occurring during meiosis.",
        "Choice 3": "During meiosis, a reduction of chromosomes resulted in 23.",
        "Choice 4": "The patient will have a single X chromosome and infertility.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nDuring meiosis, a pair of chromosomes may fail to separate completely, creating a sperm or oocyte that contains either two copies or no copy of a particular chromosome. This sporadic event, called nondisjunction, can lead to trisomy. Down syndrome is an example of trisomy. The mother does not have a mutation of chromosome 21, which is indicated in the question. Also, trisomy does not produce a single X chromosome and infertility. Genes are packaged and arranged in a linear order within chromosomes, which are located in the cell nucleus. In humans, 46 chromosomes occur in pairs in all body cells except oocytes and sperm, which contain only 23 chromosomes.",

        "Choice 1": "Peripheral and pulmonary edema",
        "Choice 2": "Thrombotic organ damage",
        "Choice 3": "Metastasis of a glioblastoma",
        "Choice 4": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nSickle cell anemia is an example of a genetic condition caused by a small gene mutation that affects protein structure, producing hemoglobin S. A person who inherits two copies of the hemoglobin S gene mutation has sickle cell anemia and experiences the symptoms of severe anemia and thrombotic organ damage resulting in hypoxia. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a neurodegenerative disease that can occur as a result of an inherited mutation, but not a mutation of hemoglobin S. The patient with sickle cell anemia may experience edema, but it would not be related to the gene mutation. A glioblastoma is a neurologic tumor."

Based on the nurse's knowledge of neurofibromatosis, the nurse understands that a single family member has which of the following?",
        "Choice 1": "A spontaneous mutation",
        "Choice 2": "A germline mutation",
        "Choice 3": "A nondisjunction",
        "Choice 4": "A monosomy",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nSpontaneous mutations take place in individual oocytes or sperm at the time of conception. These mutations are not inherited in other family members. However, a person who carries the new “spontaneous” mutation may pass on the mutation to his or her children. Achondroplasia, Marfan syndrome, and neurofibromatosis type 1 are examples of genetic conditions that may occur in a single family member as a result of spontaneous mutation. Germline mutations are passed on to all daughter cells when body cells replicate. During meiosis, a pair of chromosomes may fail to separate completely, creating a sperm or oocyte that contains two copies or no copy of a particular chromosome. This sporadic event, called nondisjunction, can lead to either trisomy or a monosomy."

        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nHuntington disease is an autosomal dominant disorder. Autosomal dominant inherited conditions affect female and male family members equally and follow a vertical pattern of inheritance in families. A person who has an autosomal dominant inherited condition carries a gene mutation for that condition on one chromosome pair. Each of that person's offspring has a 50% chance of inheriting the gene mutation for the condition and a 50% chance of inheriting the normal version of the gene."

The woman and her husband are concerned about the chances of their son or daughter developing a retinoblastoma. What is important for the nurse to explain to the couple?",
        "Choice 1": "Retinoblastoma is an autosomal recessive inheritance in which each parent carries the gene mutation.",
        "Choice 2": "Retinoblastoma is an X-linked inheritance and all males inherit an X chromosome from their mothers.",
        "Choice 3": "Retinoblastoma is an autosomal dominant inheritance that has incomplete penetrance and can skip a generation.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nRetinoblastoma is an autosomal dominant inheritance that has incomplete penetrance, and the gene appears to skip a generation, thus leading to errors in interpreting family history and in genetic counseling. Autosomal recessive conditions have a pattern that is more horizontal than vertical; relatives of a single generation tend to have the condition. Genetic conditions inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern are frequently seen among particular ethnic groups and usually occur more often in children of parents who are related by blood, such as first cousins. X-linked conditions may be inherited in recessive or dominant patterns. In both, the gene mutation is located on the X chromosome."

She states she has lost two pregnancies and she shares with the nurse that she does not know why she lost the babies. Based on this patient's history, what recommendation should the nurse make at the present time?",
        "Choice 1": "Instruct her to continue to try to get pregnant",
        "Choice 2": "Let the patient know that her loss may not occur again",
        "Choice 3": "Encourage her explore the possibility of chromosome testing studies",
        "Choice 4": "Instruct her to have an amniocentesis with the next pregnancy",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nAt the present time, the nurse should inform the woman about chromosome studies. Chromosome studies may be needed at any age, depending on the indication. Two common indications are a suspected diagnosis, such as Down syndrome, and a history of two or more unexplained pregnancy losses, which the woman has described. The other answers are incorrect because instructing the woman to continue to try to get pregnant is redundant. The woman has already said she is trying to get pregnant. She should have an amniocentesis with the next pregnancy, but this is not as imperative as the chromosome studies. Telling the patient she will not experience another loss would be a belittling response. It is her choice to have the chromosome studies, but it is important that the nurse explain all the risks surrounding pregnancy and pregnancy loss based on the patient's history."

        "Choice 1": "“Genetic screening is a way to determine the rate of infectious disease in babies during this vulnerable time in their lives.”",
        "Choice 2": "“It is important to screen newborns to determine their future cancer risk and appraise the quality of prenatal care they received.”",

She states her mother had some kind of illness in which she had to be institutionalized at age 42 and passed away at age 45. She stated, “My mother forgot who we were when she was institutionalized.” Based on this information, what does the nurse suspect?",
        "Choice 1": "Huntington disease",
        "Choice 2": "Schizophrenia",
        "Choice 3": "Cerebrovascular accident",
        "Choice 4": "Alzheimer's disease",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nNurses must be alert for family histories indicating that multiple generations (autosomal dominant inheritance) or multiple siblings (autosomal recessive inheritance) are affected with the same condition or that onset of disease is earlier than expected (multiple generations with early onset). When a family history of disease is identified, the nurse must be responsible for making the patient aware that this family history is a risk factor for disease. Huntington disease is noted with mental deterioration, but the patient presents with jerky movements of the head and limbs. Cerebrovascular accident can occur in a woman her age, but there is no evidence of signs or symptoms of this condition in the patient scenario. Schizophrenia is highly unlikely."

A 50-year-old man states, “My father had colon cancer, but I really don't understand why that means that I need a colonoscopy.” What could the nurse do to disseminate information about screening to more individuals?",
        "Choice 1": "Plan a health fair for the employees that provides information about screening for diseases that have an inheritance pattern.",
        "Choice 2": "Refer each employee over the age of 50 to a gastroenterologist.",

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe advantage of a health fair is that it will provide information on all age-related diseases and the prevention of disease. It would be impossible for the nurse to refer all employees over the age of 50 to a gastroenterologist. Creating a Web site may not meet workers' needs.

        "Question": "A couple wants to start a family and they are concerned that their child will be at risk for cystic fibrosis because they each have a cousin with cystic fibrosis. What should the nurse practitioner tell them about cystic fibrosis?",
        "Choice 1": "It is an autosomal dominant disorder.",
        "Choice 2": "It is passed by mitochondrial inheritance.",
        "Choice 3": "It is an X-linked inherited disorder.",
        "Choice 4": "It is an autosomal recessive disorder.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nCystic fibrosis is autosomal recessive. Nurses also consider other issues when assessing the risk for genetic conditions in couples and families. For example, when obtaining a preconception or prenatal family history, the nurse asks if the prospective parents have common ancestors. This is important to know because people who are related have more genes in common than those who are unrelated, thus increasing their chance for having children with autosomal recessive inherited condition such as cystic fibrosis. Mitochondrial inheritance occurs with defects in energy conversion and affects the nervous system, kidney, muscle, and liver. X-linked inheritance, which has been inherited from a mutant allele of the mother, affects males. Autosomal dominant is an X-linked dominant genetic disease."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nPhysical assessment may provide clues that a particular genetic condition is present in a person and family. Family history assessment may offer initial guidance regarding the particular area for physical assessment. For example, a family history of neurofibromatosis type 1, an inherited condition involving tumors of the central nervous system, would prompt the nurse to carry out a detailed assessment of closely related family members. Skin findings, such as café-au-lait spots, axillary freckling, or tumors of the skin (neurofibromas), would warrant referral for further evaluation, including genetic evaluation and counseling. A family history of familial hypercholesterolemia would alert the nurse to assess family members for symptoms of hyperlipidemias (xanthomas, corneal arcus, abdominal pain of unexplained origin). As another example, increased urination could indicate type 1 diabetes. Projectile vomiting is indicative of pyloric stensosis."

This includes assessment of factors that may interfere with informed consent, such as hearing loss, language differences, cognitive impairment, and the effects of medication. The nurse's best action is to inform the geneticist that the couple cannot give informed consent until a translator is available. The other answers are incorrect because just having the couple sign the form or explaining it in English and then having them sign the form does not allow you to know that the husband understands what he is signing.

The nurse does not provide the patient with a detailed plan of ADLs, though promotion of ADLs is a priority."

Even though the man lives alone and has no family, he has been managing well at home until now. What would be the most appropriate action for the nurse to take?",
        "Choice 1": "Reassess the patient's psychosocial status and make the necessary referrals",
        "Choice 2": "Have the patient volunteer in the community for social contact",
        "Choice 3": "Arrange for the patient to be reassessed by his social worker",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nThe patient is exhibiting signs of depression and should be reassessed and a referral made as necessary. Patients with chronic illness are at an increased risk of depression. It would be simplistic to arrange for him to volunteer or focus on the positive. Social work may or may not be needed; assessment should precede such a referral."

It is at this time, the patient says, that he tends to experience chest pain. What might you counsel the patient to do to decrease the likelihood of angina in the morning?",
        "Choice 1": "Shower in the evening and shave before breakfast.",
        "Choice 2": "Skip breakfast and eat an early lunch.",
        "Choice 3": "Take a nitro tab prior to breakfast.",
        "Choice 4": "Shower once a week and shave prior to breakfast.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nIf the nurse determines that one of the situations most likely to precipitate angina is to shower and shave after breakfast, the nurse might counsel the patient to break these activities into different times during the day. Skipping breakfast and eating an early lunch would not decrease the likelihood of angina in the morning. Taking a nitro tablet before breakfast is inappropriate because the event requiring the medication has not yet occurred. Also, suggesting that the patient shower once a week and shave prior to breakfast is an incorrect suggestion because showering and shaving can both be done every day if they are spread out over the course of the day."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback:\r\nDevelopmental disabilities are those that occur any time from birth to 22 years of age and result in impairment of physical or mental health, cognition, speech, language, or self-care. Examples of developmental disabilities are spina bifida, cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, and muscular dystrophy. Acquired disabilities may occur as a result of an acute and sudden injury, acute nontraumatic disorders, or progression of a chronic disorder.

What information would be appropriate for the nurse to share with the patient?",
        "Choice 1": "“Limited finances are a common problem for patients with a disability. Since you were hospitalized this year, you can likely forego the gynecologic exam and mammogram.”",
        "Choice 2": "“These are very important health preventative measures, so you will need to borrow the money to pay for the exam and mammogram.”",
        "Choice 3": "“I'll look into federal assistance programs that provide financial assistance for health-related expenses for people with disabling conditions.”",
