        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The nurse should suggest that staff use the term “mentally ill,” thus, reinforcing that the client has an illness. The term “nervous breakdown” is too general and nonspecific for clinical usage. Saying nothing or asking staff what terminology to use is not implementing the client–advocate role of the professional nurse.",

        "Choice 4": "4. Dictionary of common mental disorders",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Mental disorders are identified, standardized, and categorized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). All members of the health care team use this reference. A psychiatric nursing care plan manual is a reference for nursing care and a dictionary will offer only a general definition.

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Deviant religious beliefs and behavior are not generally labeled as mental disorders unless the deviance is a symptom of dysfunction.

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The nurse should instruct that given the right circumstances, anyone can have a mental health problem or disorder. The nursing assistant’s ability to be therapeutic with clients may be decreased if misinformation is not corrected. Referring the assistant back to the orientation materials, alerting the nursing manager, and ignoring the comment do not address the situation directly.

        "Explanation": "A mental disorder is a psychological group of symptoms in which an individual experiences distress, or impairment in one or more areas of functioning, or a significant increased risk of suffering, pain, loss of freedom, or death. Grieving after a loss is a normal grief response and does not constitute a mental disorder.",

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders provides diagnostic criteria that all members of the health care team will use in the diagnosis process and will serve as a resource for assessment and analysis of data. While communication with the primary care provider is appropriate, knowledge of the DSM is expected in a graduate nurse and this choice does not reflect an application of basic knowledge. A medical dictionary is not specific enough for diagnostic purposes. Documentation of all subjective and objective data is not appropriate and will confuse relevant from irrelevant data.",

During the nursing assessment of the client, the nurse finds the client’s beliefs and actions related to many health practices to stray from the norm. Which action would be most appropriate for the nurse to take at this time?",

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "A thorough assessment is needed before proceeding with other steps of the nursing process. Behavior that is considered bizarre in one cultural context may be considered desirable in another. While findings will be communicated and used for nursing diagnosis formulation, these steps are built upon a thorough assessment.

Given the cultural, social, ethical, and legal considerations, there is no definition of deviance that covers all clinical situations. The duration of the beliefs and actions in this situation may be irrelevant.

They think well of themselves and others, but are also realistic about their own and others’ abilities and shortcomings. They can accept the ups and downs of life and often come out even stronger than before. They have a wide range of behaviors, emotions, and values that are usually consistent with one another.

Seventeenth century society created houses of confinement where, for the entertainment of onlookers, mad persons were publicly beaten and tortured. The belief that the mentally ill were divinely inspired and thus treated with care and benevolence was held by the early Arab world.

The belief that mental disorder was linked to faulty life habit and interactions was consistent with the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

        "Explanation": "The Psychiatric–Mental Health Nursing Standards of Practice delineates psychiatric–mental health nursing roles and functions and serves as guidelines for providing quality care. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders is used by the mental health care team, particularly the psychiatrist, to diagnose clients with mental disorders and is not specific to nursing care issues. The Code of Ethics helps to clarify right and wrong actions by the nurse, but does not clarify roles and nursing care actions.

        "Explanation": "The purpose of partnering and collaborating with other disciplines is to make the best use of the different abilities of mental health team members in order to facilitate client progress toward therapeutic goals. While client-centered interpersonal interaction within a therapeutic relationship is a vital piece of the treatment plan, interpersonal interaction unto itself may not be the needed focus.

The nurse should communicate to the client that decisions related to the sharing of information would take into consideration any agreement regarding disclosure that exists between the nurse and the client and how the receiving party will use the information in the client’s best interest. Not all information is significant to the client’s reason for treatment. The nurse should communicate circumstances where significant information will be shared. In the spirit of collaboration, the mental health team should involve the client. This assures that clients are informed consumers of mental health services.

        "Explanation": "Although it is true that in the context of her time Nightingale emphasized the physical environment, she did have an impact on psychiatric–mental health nursing. Nightingale was among the first to note that the influence of nurses on their clients goes beyond physical care and has psychological and social components; hence, the value of making her famous evening rounds to say goodnight.

Within this act, psychiatric nursing was added to psychiatry, psychology, and social work as a field in which the highest priority became the preparation of clinically capable persons for positions of leadership. Commonsense Psychiatry, written by Adolf Meyer, had great impact on psychiatry; however, it did not have a noticeable influence on psychiatric nursing.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Asking for support indicates that the nurse recognizes the emotional challenges of working on a locked psychiatric unit, has engaged in self-reflection, and realizes the value of sharing perceptions, feelings, and concerns with professional colleagues in order to fulfill professional responsibilities. Thinking that one would need a course in self-defense reflects the self-view that the nurse’s personal integration is threatened by the environment of the locked unit. Believing that there is a fine line between the clients and staff reveals the nurse has difficulty separating his or her own identity from the client’s.

Asking for guidance or reviewing the literature before examining one’s feelings indicates that the nurse is unaware or uncomfortable with feelings and relies on others for guidance.

        "Explanation": "Acknowledging that caring for the client may be a challenge is the correct answer. Self-awareness of one’s feelings and potential emotional responses to a situation is essential to develop empathy. The nurse recognizes that before meeting any client, it is important to recognize one’s feelings and clarify beliefs and attitudes, especially when receiving medical information that might be unusual or even frightening. Assessing the client’s needs and abilities and interviewing the family may be helpful in caring for this client, but will not necessarily enhance the nurse’s self-awareness.

Sharing personal beliefs with clients indicates the nurse cannot separate the nurse’s identity from the client’s identity. Setting rigid boundaries indicates the nurse’s identity is threatened by the client’s behaviors.

        "Explanation": "Asking the client to clarify concerns about medications shows that the nurse recognizes the client’s goals may be different from the nurse’s. Telling the client that refusing medications will result in getting ill or prevent discharge conveys that the nurse is threatened by the client’s assertiveness.

Although the wisdom of self-disclosure has been the subject of much debate, there are studies that support the judicious use of self-disclosure. Before using self-disclosure with a client, the nurse must consider not only if it will take the focus away from the client, but also the context of the therapeutic relationship and give attention to the timing, appropriateness, and degree.

The nurse who teaches the client techniques to interrupt hallucinations operates from the model that the client is not to be blamed for the hallucinations but can take steps to manage the symptoms.

Stating that because of therapy one understands the culture of those with mental illness suggests that psychotherapy is the only way to gain awareness of sociocultural differences.",

        "Choice 1": "1. Arrange for an interpreter to assist.",
        "Choice 2": "2. Ask a family member to stay during the assessment interview.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "In planning culturally competent care, the nurse must not make assumptions regarding a client’s language preference and/or cultural needs. The nurse does not follow a predetermined plan for assessing clients, but instead takes the time to determine client needs based on the client’s responses. Arranging for an interpreter or asking a family member to stay makes a predetermined assumption about the client’s cultural needs or issues before a thorough assessment is done. While following an admission assessment form may assist the nurse in the process of admitting the client, assessing the client’s cultural preferences requires time and creativity to which a predetermined assessment form may not lend itself.",

Although developing a thorough understanding of Buddhist religion will assist the nurse in providing culturally competent care, it is not always possible to do so before encountering a client who is Buddhist. Explaining western medical ideas or using standard nursing interventions will not assist the nurse in delivering culturally competent care.",

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Nurses who are culturally competent assess symptoms in light of clients’ cultural norms by obtaining a cultural profile. Consulting the physician will not assist in assessing and interpreting this symptom based on the client’s cultural norms. Questioning the client’s family may provide additional assessment data for a cultural profile but does not impact the degree to which the client experiences the symptoms.

        "Choice 2": "2. “I can understand that you are feeling depressed right now. It must have been a very difficult decision to make. I’ll sit here with you for a while.”",

        "Explanation": "Conveying an understanding of the client’s feelings, acknowledging the difficulty of the decision, and offering to sit with her conveys the nurse’s ability to respond to and understand the experience of the client on her terms. Self-disclosure of the nurse’s experience to validate the client’s experience does not convey empathy and may overwhelm the client. Saying you are sorry and wishing things could be different conveys sympathy, not empathy. Saying that it is a sad situation and that it is a shame it did not work out invalidates the client’s experience and shuts down expression of feelings.",

Telling the client what would be best is giving advice. Asking the client why she would give up the baby does not convey the nurse’s interest in the client’s experience and limits therapeutic communication.

        "Explanation": "By responding to the client’s feelings and offering assistance, the nurse demonstrates an understanding of the client’s need for safety and security. Acknowledging the client’s fear and then changing the focus to policy invalidates the client’s experience. Telling the client that she has already had a month to work on a plan and offering to review the options conveys a judgmental attitude toward the client.

Self-disclosure of the nurse’s experience and suggesting a housekeeper takes the focus away from the client’s experience. Although acknowledging that caring for a person with dementia is too much for one person can validate the client’s experience, suggesting a nursing home conveys the nurse’s personal opinion rather than offering an option that will support the client’s needs.

Suggesting that the nurse has trouble with clients who lose control and asking to talk about it as a group makes an assumption and threatens the nurse’s self-esteem. Stating that it is not a responsibility of the staff to determine whether clients have problems fails to address the nurse’s concerns.

Requesting to be alone during break time demonstrates the nurse’s need for self-care after responding to the needs of clients.

A formal one-to-one relationship requires more planning, consistency and time than an informal therapeutic relationship, but this is not a feature distinguishing professional relationships from social relationships.

        "Question": "A client who is being discharged offers the nurse a ceramic bowl made during hospitalization as a symbol of the open “vessel” the client has become for accepting new ideas. What is the best response by the nurse?",
        "Choice 1": "1. “This is a beautiful gesture, I will place it in the day room for everyone to enjoy.”",
        "Choice 2": "2. “I wish I could accept this, but you know I’m not allowed to.”",
        "Choice 3": "3. “Let me pay you for this. I don’t feel I should just accept it after all the hard work you put into it.”",

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Gifts are most often given during the termination phase of one-to-one relationships. It is appropriate to accept a gift if feelings and the motive for giving the gift have been clarified. Placing a breakable object in the day room of an inpatient unit is inappropriate due to safety risks. Refusing to accept the gift is a personal choice the nurse could make; however, the client may feel disappointed and rejected by this refusal. Paying the client for any item is discouraged and usually against hospital policy.",

        "Choice 1": "1. This gesture is inappropriate because it could seem condescending to the client.",
        "Choice 2": "2. This gesture is appropriately timed and suitable in this situation.",

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "A firm handshake and a statement of congratulations are facilitative in this instance during the working phase of the relationship. The use of touch is appropriate in many instances with many clients if timed and offered correctly. A handshake and congratulatory statement in this situation does not have any sexual or condescending overtones.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Annoyance and hostility toward a client are signs of countertransference, indicating that the nurse has assigned irrational meaning to the nurse–client relationship that belongs to other past relationships of the nurse. Ordinary concern, feeling comfortable, or mentally reviewing the interaction after meeting with the client are expected behaviors and do not indicate countertransference.",

        "Explanation": "Mutual goal-setting is a common activity in the orientation or beginning phase to delineate the client’s expectations and the nurse’s responsibilities in a therapeutic alliance. In-depth exploration of relationships and the identification of dysfunctional thoughts and emotions commonly occur in the working or middle phase of the relationship. The emphasis of growth and positive aspects of the relationship is the goal of the termination or end phase.",

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Asking the client to identify specific accomplishments to achieve in the therapeutic relationship is a common question to ask during the orientation phase. Asking questions about relationships and problematic behaviors is more appropriate upon entering the working phase, after establishing trust and rapport with the client.

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Helping the client to learn and apply problem-solving strategies will provide the knowledge and tools the client needs to make constructive changes. Confidentiality issues and negotiation for the time and place of interactions should be addressed in the orientation phase prior to entering the working phase. Reminding the client that change is expected before discharge may produce stress and anxiety placing undue pressure on the client.

        "Choice 1": "1. The client verbalizes willingness to change ineffective coping patterns and self-defeating behaviors.",
        "Choice 2": "2. The client expresses awareness of potential causes of dysfunctional behavioral patterns.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The use of adaptive coping strategies on a daily basis is a useful criterion for determining readiness to terminate the therapeutic relationship. Expressing awareness of and willingness to change ineffective or dysfunctional coping behaviors indicates the client is still in the working phase of the relationship and more work needs to be done. Clarification of roles and responsibilities during relationship work may be necessary in either the orientation or working phase, but should be clearly understood by the end phase of the relationship.",

        "Choice 1": "1. “I’m going to miss our sessions together, but I think you’re ready to handle difficult situations on your own.”",
        "Choice 2": "2. “I think two or three more sessions are necessary for you to develop more confidence in using this new coping skill effectively.”",
        "Choice 3": "3. “I’m skeptical of your ability to assert yourself when new conflicts occur in future relationships, so be careful.”",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Uncertainty or doubt that the client is able to continue newly developed skills is a barrier to successful separation between nurse and client. This statement indicates the nurse has regrets that the client did not obtain sufficient skills to function independently. Suggesting additional sessions to allow for confidence to build and identifying conditions in which it would be appropriate for the client to contact the therapist are appropriate ways to wrap up the therapeutic nurse–client relationship.

        "Choice 1": "1. Discussion of sensitive issues should only occur in the working phase.",
        "Choice 2": "2. Formulation of nursing diagnoses should be avoided until all essential data is obtained.",
        "Choice 3": "3. Information that is avoided or omitted is often more crucial than what is shared.",

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Observation is essential to clinical practice, particularly in one-to-one relationships. Non-verbal behavior and missing information can indicate an area that requires further exploration. Sensitive issues can be discussed in all phases of the therapeutic relationship, particularly if it is valuable in providing direction for nursing care. A preliminary nursing diagnosis should be formulated based on dominant themes or central issues that may be revised as client behaviors unfold during the course of the one-to-one relationship. Resistive behaviors do not commonly disappear on their own and must be addressed openly for the therapeutic nurse–client relationship to progress.",

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Tuning in to the process involves paying attention to verbal and non-verbal cues to identify and respond to client “themes.” Acknowledging the client’s misery is one way to respond to client “themes.” Asking related questions about the marriage such as duration of the marriage, number of children, or possible infidelity are all examples of responding to the content of the interaction.

        "Choice 2": "2. “I feel so depressed all the time. I don’t know what to do or who to turn to.”",

The sense that the nurse has made contact with the client and is committed to addressing the client’s problem is a sign of an effective working relationship.

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Encouraging an in-depth exploration of the client’s feelings and thoughts can contribute to increased insight. Moving too quickly and incompletely through an exploration of feelings may explain the client’s inability to maintain new behaviors. Encouraging the client to express responses to criticism freely is inappropriate because of the risk of harm to self or others. Insisting the client take a time-out, or offering the client a PRN medication for agitation, may be appropriate for immediate action, but would not be necessary during the next one-to-one therapeutic session.",

Clients who are ambivalent regarding the termination of a therapeutic relationship may exhibit regressive behaviors and revert to previous self-defeating behaviors in an attempt to prolong treatment and avoid separation.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Because all behavior has meaning, the nurse must develop interventions that recognize personal meanings and are person-specific. Grouping clients by diagnosis and using standardized approaches ignores this premise. In voicing generalized reassurance, the nurse invalidates the principle that people interpret the world in their own way.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "To understand clients’ actions, the psychiatric–mental health nurse must identify the meanings those actions have for them. Assumptions about peer pressure, painful experiences, and the need to retreat from life stressors indicate the nurse discounts the meaning of the experiences to the client. It is essential that psychiatric–mental health nurses take into account the social and cultural environment of each client and not make generalizations about cause or meanings of experiences.

        "Choice 1": "1. The client’s psychobiologic health, rehabilitation, self-care potential, and discharge arrangements are interrelated.",
        "Choice 2": "2. Reliance on the grandson and home health aide have decreased her feelings of self-worth and caused this episode of depression.",
        "Choice 3": "3. The client’s quality of life and prognosis are primarily related to her aphasia and inability to communicate.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "A holistic assessment of a client accounts for the interrelated effects of the client’s social and cultural environment as well as psychobiological health. Nurses must not assume they understand the meaning that symptoms have to the client’s quality of life, capacity to improve, or need for independence. While life changes at any age may lead to altered emotional responses, the nurse must seek to identify the meanings of events in order to plan effectively.",

With all disorders, the holistic-interactional approach to nursing must include an understanding of both biological and psychological interventions. Psychosis does not negate the creative attributes of individuals, and they are appropriately included as part of a holistic approach to nursing care.

        "Choice 2": "2. The nurse must be cautious about empowering clients as they may make poor choices that impede their progress.",
        "Choice 3": "3. The model for intervention and change requires that the nurse feel comfortable confronting clients when they resist treatment goals.",

        "Explanation": "The humanistic perspective on mental disorders implies an expanded role for psychiatric–mental health nurses who understand diversity and are prepared to work for change within social and political systems. The model for intervention and change is one of negotiation and advocacy, not directive interventions. Empowerment is a basic concept as the responsibility for change rests with the client who is viewed as accountable for his or her own behavior. Humanism contends that people have the potential to solve their own problems, thus, clients and families must be involved in treatment from the beginning.

        "Explanation": "The nurse’s key role is to help clients examine a full range of life experiences in more satisfying ways, learn new patterns of coping with stress, and generally enhance the quality of their lives and social worlds. Focusing on failure of compliance undervalues concepts of human choice and empowerment within the nurse–client relationship. The goal of the nurse–client relationship is to create a therapeutic rather than a comfortable relationship. The scope of the nurse’s role includes understanding and facilitating exploration of client issues related to basic functions rather than assuming that issues need to be managed and understood separate from the holistic view of the person.",

The nurse functions as an autonomous member of the mental health team and assumes a broad range of responsibilities within the RN scope of practice. Belief that developing rapport will decrease suicidal ideation indicates a knowledge deficit regarding the phenomenon of depression/suicidal ideation, and an unrealistic perspective on the role of the nurse.

Time-outs are only used for short periods of isolation to decease undesired behavior. Children with hyperactivity or borderline intelligence can be treated in the home when parents are taught how to use effective approaches.

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Since all behavior has meaning, appearance and non-verbal cues suggest the client is fearful and potentially alienated. The offer to include someone from the client’s larger support system recognizes the need for safety, security, and feeling connected with others. Suggesting medication for anxiety is premature without further assessment and underscores that the client is not in control of his or her emotions. The statement that a full psychiatric evaluation is needed suggests that the client has a larger problem which has not been unsubstantiated by a holistic assessment, further stigmatizing the client.

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Lithium levels are drawn every two to three months and after increases. If fluid is restricted to the point of dehydration, toxicity can occur.

This behavior continues over the next several hours. How should the nurse understand what is going on with this client?",

        "Explanation": "Reappraisal involves an ongoing reinterpretation based on new information; the client is rethinking the mistaken idea that diet was not important. Primary appraisal involves assessing benefit or harm. Secondary appraisal involves evaluating one’s coping resources and options.

        "Explanation": "Silence and respect do not indicate that the nurse agrees or supports the client’s religion, but that the nurse accepts and understands the importance of coping mechanisms. Leaving the room is not supportive of the client’s preferred coping mechanism and the client may feel offended by the nurse’s actions.

The general adaptation syndrome (GAS) of understanding the effect of stress on the body is too broad a theory to connect to smoking cessation. Life change theory helps participants learn about life stressors associated with life events and situations.

The statement that a less stressful job would remove the need to drink is a re-escalation of the client’s rationalization.

Exploring the functions of denial will help the nurse understand the client’s needs. Taking the client to the nursery would increase the client’s anxiety as it is a direct challenge to her perception of reality.

        "Explanation": "Both verbal and nonverbal behaviors are important to communication. The behaviors are compared to determine if the client’s verbal and nonverbal communication are congruent. Nonverbal communication may carry more meaning than verbal communication. It is important to remain objective when documenting; however, the rationale for documenting both is to evaluate congruence. It is important to be thorough when documenting; however, the rationale for documenting verbal and nonverbal responses is to compare for congruence.

        "Explanation": "Behavior such as fidgeting communicates an expression of discomfort; the source of the discomfort may be physical or psychological. An example of the therapeutic use of space would be to use the fidgeting as a stimulus, motivating another individual to increase the distance from the client or move away. Fidgeting is a form of body movement or kinesic communication; nonlanguage vocalizations are noises without linguistic structure. Fidgeting is a nonverbal response to a question; there is not enough data to identify if the client is trying to avoid the question; the nurse would need to engage in verbal communication to help the client identify that he or she is avoiding answering the question.",

Communication that rejects the other’s sense of self creates a disturbance in communication and can affect the relationship. Indicating that the nurse does not understand what is being said communicates information about the message, not the individual.

When communicating with a client in a state of high anxiety, the nurse utilizes communication techniques that do not require the client to engage in reflection or problem solving, as this will cause more anxiety.

        "Explanation": "The nurse is using the therapeutic communication technique of encouraging the client to explore feelings when asking the client to talk about the feelings of sadness. The technique of reflecting “You feel sad?” is therapeutic, but the better response is to encourage the client to explore the feelings about being sad to facilitate developing insight. Restating at this point would prompt a closed-ended response by focusing on the content (sad), as opposed to focusing on the behavior or feelings (sadness). Asking about the client’s history provides the client with an opportunity to shift the focus from the feelings to providing information about the client’s family; the nurse should review the client’s history prior to the interaction.

The responses either asking if the client knows who the nurse is, or stating that the client knows the nurse are not therapeutic and may be perceived as challenging to the client.

The sentences are designed to elicit responses concerning fantasies, fears, daydreams, and aspirations, among other things, and are not used to screen for cognitive dysfunction. The Thematic Apperception Test is used to reveal very important information about the client’s emotional and interpersonal tendencies and not as a screening tool for signs of cognitive dysfunction.

        "Question": "A client admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit after a recent suicide attempt tells the nurse, “Even though suicide is against my religion, I was in so much emotional distress that I didn’t think I could keep on living. I’m really struggling with my spiritual conscience and don’t know what I should do.” Which of the following nurse responses is most appropriate?",
        "Choice 1": "1. “It sounds like spirituality plays a significant role in your life. Tell me what beliefs are most important to you.”",
        "Choice 2": "2. “I’m not very comfortable discussing religious matters. This is something you should talk to your priest or pastor about.”",
        "Choice 3": "3. “I think you should pray for forgiveness and turn all your problems over to God.”",
        "Choice 4": "4. “I hear that you are having a real struggle with your spiritual beliefs. Tell me what I can do to help.”",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Asking clients to identify which spiritual beliefs are most important to them enables the nurse to reassure clients who fear that their beliefs will be challenged or minimized in a psychiatric environment. The nurse should avoid offering advice such as suggesting the client pray and turn all troubles over to God. Referring the client to a priest or pastor abdicates the nurse’s role in helping clients explore the importance of spiritual beliefs in their recovery. Asking clients to tell the nurse what can be done to help places the responsibility for action on the nurse rather than the client and does not encourage discussion of spiritual beliefs.",

        "Choice 1": "1. Take the client with psychosis by the hand and lead the client to another area in the day room.",
        "Choice 2": "2. Announce over the intercom that visiting hours are over.",
        "Choice 3": "3. Observe the situation and intervene only if the client with psychosis becomes aggressive.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The nurse needs to give instructions or directions at the level of the client’s ability. Providing a verbal prompt to a client with acute psychosis who may not realize that another client’s privacy is being invaded is the most appropriate proactive strategy. Waiting until aggressive behavior occurs before intervening puts the other client and his wife at risk. Physically leading the client away from the situation assumes a parental role and does not promote independent behavior. Announcing that visiting hours are over is not appropriate unless this is true, and it could confuse clients with psychosis who have auditory hallucinations.",

The nurse is working with the client’s family to develop a plan for managing psychotic symptoms and emergency behaviors after discharge. Which of the following nursing diagnoses is most appropriate?",
        "Choice 1": "1. Noncompliance: Medication Regimen related to paranoid ideation",
        "Choice 2": "2. Self-Care Deficit: Bathing/Hygiene related to irrational thought processes",
        "Choice 3": "3. Knowledge Deficit: Symptom Management related to inadequate understanding of disease processes",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Nurses should partner with the client and family to determine a mutually agreeable plan for a safe, secure, and supportive living arrangement following discharge. This includes a plan for managing symptoms by reducing schedule demands and/or contacting the mental health team or case manager for assistance. Family members need guidance in how to recognize relapse and exacerbation of symptoms as well as what to do in an emergency situation. Noncompliance with Medications, Self-Care Deficits, and Potential for Violent Behaviors are nursing diagnoses more appropriate for clients in the inpatient setting but do not help the family prepare for challenges after discharge.",

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The psychiatric home health nurse should provide proof of identity and the reason for knocking on the client’s door. Offering the client money, even to buy Girl Scout cookies, is unethical and can create an undesirable precedent for future visits.

If clients are not at home for scheduled visits, they are no longer homebound and need alternative arrangements for services. Calling the client the day before each scheduled visit as a reminder is appropriate, but the change in homebound status must still be addressed to prevent Medicare fraud. Waiting outside the client’s home is impractical and does not address the change in homebound status. The nurse should never enter the client’s home without the client’s permission.

        "Explanation": "Assessment and problem identification is the most important strategy to develop a plan consistent with the needs of clients who have serious and persistent mental illnesses such as recurring substance abuse.

Some MCOs deal with this problem by not scheduling future appointments until the client makes co-payment for all missed appointments.

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Distraction or a move to a quieter environment at the first sign of agitation will prevent escalation of the behavior. It will also calm the client and addresses the emotional component of the client’s experience. Ignoring the behavior will allow it to escalate. Rational discussion is not possible when a client has a diagnosis of dementia. Engagement in a high-energy activity may be too stimulating for a client that is already agitated and angry.",

Familiar objects from home, such as slippers, robe, and photographs, may help with orientation. Easily read clocks, orientation boards, and a structured routine that includes physical activity and socialization without sensory overload will also help with orientation.

        "Explanation": "Confabulation is the use of fantasy to fill in the memory gaps that they are unable to remember. This is an ego-protective mechanism. Difficulty in finding words and naming objects may suggest expressive aphasia, while difficulty grasping complex concepts may suggest receptive aphasia.

Clients will be unable to participate fully in a recovery program until they can admit that they have a substance abuse problem, admit the extent of that problem, and acknowledge how it has impacted their life.

        "Explanation": "Naltrexone blocks the craving for alcohol and the pleasure derived from drinking. If alcohol is ingested while taking the medication disulfiram (Antabuse), a potentially lethal reaction can occur. Since naltrexone will not react with alcohol, it is not necessary to limit use of over-the-counter products that contain alcohol.

        "Explanation": "It is a priority to determine when the last drink was ingested because alcohol withdrawal will occur after the client stops drinking. Blackouts are anterograde amnesia and a symptom of alcohol abuse. Asking if a client drinks regularly isn’t an appropriate question for a client suspected of alcohol abuse. It isn’t necessary to know whom the client drinks with.",

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "A hallucination is a real experience to the individual To maintain a therapeutic relationship, the nurse should convey acceptance of the client’s experience. Acknowledging disbelief of the auditory hallucination may affect the nurse’s ability to engage in a therapeutic nurse–client relationship. Clients who are low functioning may benefit from assistance with their activities of daily living, such as assisting with dressing. A client who is at risk for harming self or others may need to be isolated to help him or her feel safe by minimizing access to potentially harmful objects. Nurses need to be informed of potential side effects of medications in order to monitor for side effects and instructing others.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Providing privacy for the client to visit with his or her family demonstrates that the nurse is being sensitive to the client’s right to privacy. Providing encouragement for a client to attend group is a therapeutic intervention to prevent social isolation, not sensitivity. Eating in the dining room with the clients is an example of the nurse modeling positive social skills, not sensitivity. Reporting a client’s compliance with medication to the psychiatrist is appropriate but is not an example of sensitivity.",

        "Explanation": "An expansive mood and organizing a unit pool tournament is correct because though the client may have an expansive mood, the client was able to focus thinking and follow through with organizing an activity. Pressured speech is a symptom of mania. Seductive and inappropriate clothing is a symptom of mania. Irritability and hyperactivity are indicative of an ongoing acute manic phase.

In bereavement, this client is sad in response to the death of his wife. He is not mentally ill. When a client has resolved his grieving to the point of making plans for the future, it is not dysfunctional grieving. In delayed grief, the client would avoid his feelings.

        "Explanation": "Object loss theory is correct because it addresses the separation of an infant from the primary caregiver during the first six months of life. Genetic theory deals with heredity; there is no information to indicate that the depression was inherited. Cognitive theory believes depression is based on distorted cognition. There is no information given to support this theory. Gender theory states that men are not as prone to depression as women—the client is male.",

The nurse needs to teach ways to change the thinking on this client’s stressor. Object loss theory addresses the separation of an infant from the primary caregiver during the first six months of life and does not address the client’s thought pattern.

        "Explanation": "Administering PRN zolpidem tartrate (Ambien) does not suppress REM sleep and is effective for sleep. Sleep should be encouraged because sleep deprivation may enhance mood disorder symptoms. Having the night nurse talk with the client does not encourage the client to rest.

It assesses for initial suicidal risk and the need for increased safety precautions. “What about your children? They are so cute and wonderful!” changes the topic and a cheerful attitude about the children does not make a depressed person feel better or assess for safety needs. “You have such a good life!” does not encourage expression of thoughts and feelings. “Don’t worry.

Using a strict regular schedule for client observation allows the client to predict when staff will not be present.

        "Explanation": "Serum levels must be tested regularly to prevent drug toxicity. The client must have adequate salt and fluid intake.

        "Explanation": "A cheerful and outgoing attitude does not make the client feel better. It may be more comfortable for the nurse to avoid dealing with the client’s feelings, but it may lead the client to feel worse, because their feelings seem less important. Warmth and patience are beneficial. Clients with depression may have trouble when others talk too quickly or do not seem to understand, so communication that is slow and empathic would be beneficial. Clients with depression do not want to do things like get out of bed, shower, and put on clothes. They must be encouraged to do so.",

An extroverted personality is not needed to work effectively with mood-disordered clients. Many personality types are able to work with clients.

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Clients who are hospitalized for depression will be disinterested in a nurse–client relationship. It is easy for the nurse to internalize the client’s mood if the nurse is not self-aware. Depressed clients are usually not open to working on their problems. They may feel hopeless and helpless. Depressed clients may not show improvement within 24 hours of hospitalization.

        "Question": "A psychiatric nurse is providing an educational session to the emergency room staff to raise awareness on the topic of elder abuse. Which client is most at risk for elder abuse?",
        "Choice 1": "1. An 82-year-old woman with middle-stage dementia",
        "Choice 2": "2. A 73-year-old woman living in a poor neighborhood",
        "Choice 3": "3. A 70-year-old man with the recent diagnosis of heart disease",
        "Choice 4": "4. An 89-year-old man living with a mentally ill family member",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The typical elder abuse victim is a woman of advanced age with physical and/or mental impairment who usually depends on the abuser for care. The client with dementia is the most defenseless as the result of the disease process and requires significant hands-on assistance and care. Socio-economic factors are not relevant. Elders with health-related problems are often still capable of independent living and of attending to their needs.",

        "Question": "A client with a history of physical and sexual abuse by her husband is admitted to the hospital for treatment of vaginal lacerations. While hospitalized, the client expresses concerns to the nurse about her safety when she returns home. The first priority for the nurse is to:",
        "Choice 1": "1. Offer to contact outpatient services if the client promises that she will not return home after her discharge.",
        "Choice 2": "2. Encourage the client to take charge of her situation.",
        "Choice 3": "3. Make it clear to the client that her husband needs to see a therapist.",
        "Choice 4": "4. Assist the client to devise a safety or escape plan.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "A victim of abuse by a partner should have a safety plan. This is the highest priority because the client's physical and/or mental health is in danger. The nurse should not assume that the client will be able to control her partner, and suggesting that the client tell the abusive partner to see a therapist could escalate the abuse. Encouraging a client to take charge is a very general suggestion. The client needs specific tools to develop a safety plan. It may not be safe or feasible for the client to leave home right away, and resources should not be withheld if a client is unable to promise to leave home.",

        "Choice 1": "1. Acknowledge the client’s inability to change the situation.",
        "Choice 2": "2. Do not ask direct questions about abuse as this will intimidate the client.",
        "Choice 3": "3. Invite the abuser to the assessment session.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "It may be more dangerous for the client to leave at this time, and the client may have to wait until an opportunity arises. The client should not be discouraged from working on preventing future violence. Having the abuser present may prevent the client from talking openly to the nurse. The nurse should ask direct questions.",

The client states the headache and the bald spots resulted from an “accident.” The client’s partner, who has accompanied the client into the exam room, often finishes the client’s sentences. The nurse should:",
        "Choice 1": "1. Ask the partner to remain in the waiting room while the client is examined.",
        "Choice 2": "2. Alert hospital security about the potential for violence.",

        "Choice 4": "4. Contact the local authorities.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "An implausible explanation for a client's injuries and a partner's pattern of finishing the client's sentences should arouse the nurse's suspicion that the client may be the victim of spousal abuse. Asking the partner to remain in the waiting room allows the client to speak more freely. The nurse should assure the client that privacy is maintained so the client can talk about what has really occurred. Additional assessment needs to be done prior to involving the authorities. Usually abusers do not act out in the presence of others, so alerting hospital security may be unnecessary.",

        "Question": "In assessing a client who has suffered domestic violence, the nurse observes that the client is regressing back to childhood, is having difficulty trusting the nurse, is expressing rage and grief, and is talking about how unfair God has been and wondering why God has been “so insensitive.” Based on these observations, what would be the most appropriate plan of action for the nurse?",
        "Choice 1": "1. Suggest that the client join a survivor support group.",
        "Choice 2": "2. Encourage the client to attend religious activities at the local church.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Religious counselors often understand the emotional issues surrounding abuse and violence, and are sensitive to the needs of survivors to work slowly through their spiritual struggles. Encouraging the client to attend religious activities does not address the issues of trust, rage, and grief, and minimizes their severity. Although a survivor support group can be helpful, the client at this phase requires specific, consistent, and ongoing professional assistance to work through those intense feelings. Stating that God has his own reasons is a personal opinion and has no therapeutic value.",

        "Choice 1": "1. Indicates to the victim that this is an incorrect view.",
        "Choice 2": "2. Makes it clear to the client that the rape was not a punishment for the client's own behavior.",
        "Choice 3": "3. Acknowledges the client's spiritual frustration and invites the client to express these feelings.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The nurse validates the client’s spiritual struggle and at the same time invites the client to express these feelings. This allows the client to grieve and ultimately to heal. The other responses are nontherapeutic, offer judgment, minimize the client’s spiritual struggle, and/or may inhibit the client's willingness to work through feelings of guilt and responsibility for the attack.",

This is an important component of the process that will help the client move to a phase of self-forgiveness and healing.

        "Explanation": "Schools are controlled, structured environments intended to foster individuality, respect, and learning. Research supports that as many as 80% of male abusers come from homes in which they were abused or observed their mothers being abused.

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Caring for an older adult at home can cause the family to become frustrated, overextended, and financially depleted. Knowing where to go in the community for assistance with caregiving can bring significant relief and, as a result, reduce violence. Outlining a specific plan for how to handle stressful caregiving shows that the caregiver has developed some effective coping skills. Realizing the unfairness of the treatment does not guarantee that the individual has a realistic, appropriate, and specific plan in place on how to cope with the stressors of caregiving. Saying that the abuse will never happen again does not indicate that the person has a specific plan in place to ensure that it does not happen again. Similarly, making sure that all of the father’s needs are met is vague and unrealistic and does not present positive coping skills that the person has to deal with the demands of care.",

        "Explanation": "Caring for an older adult at home can be difficult and time consuming as well as physically, emotionally, and financially burdensome. Ongoing, accumulated stress can lead to violence. Knowing where to go in the community for assistance with caring can bring significant relief and, as a result, reduce violence. Focusing on legal consequences and asking abusers to come forward may place families on the defensive.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Empowering the victim is an important step in the recovery process. The victim knows that what is happening is wrong and that there may be setbacks, but the nurse's role is to help set the stage for movement towards an abuse-free future.

This is important and relevant to discuss with the child’s teacher who is a member of the treatment team. Problems with socialization and communication difficulties are also common, evidenced by deficits in spontaneous, imaginative play. Stereotypic movement disorder involves repetitive nonfunctional motor behavior (i.e., hand waving, self-biting, body rocking, or head banging) that interferes with normal activity or risks self-inflicted bodily injury. The behavior lasts 4 weeks or longer. These behaviors are seemingly driven and protective measures are usually needed so that medical treatment will not be necessary. These children will have difficulty adapting to change, so they will have great difficulty, if able at all, to be flexible or contribute to their learning.

Observing a child at play can also provide invaluable information about motor behavior, thought content, affect, and impulse control. There is a general belief that toys with ambiguous meaning and diverse uses foster symbolic play more effectively because they allow the child to project his or her own identity and function onto the toys.

        "Explanation": "The development of an adolescent’s sense of identity entails a preoccupation with self-image. It also entails a connection between future role and past experiences. In this case, the teen is drawing from positive experiences with the past, which is developmentally appropriate. The teen’s response did not indicate regressive behavior.

        "Explanation": "It is usually more effective to work with adolescents in a group. Because the values, acceptance, and recognition of peers are so important during adolescence, the group can provide support for dealing with problem-solving and affecting change.

        "Explanation": "To avoid the possibility that this statement is a symptom characteristic of a further problem, the nurse utilizes therapeutic communication to explore the adolescent’s perception of self, as adolescents’ have a need for peer acceptance. Isolation could be symptomatic of an underlying problem. The findings should be documented and shared with the treatment team, but this is not the priority action at this time.

Part of the assessment will include gathering data regarding the foster parents’ disciplinary practices. Telling them they need to be more therapeutic, not punitive, is inappropriate and nontherapeutic. Part of being therapeutic is holding the child accountable for his actions, which may result in punitive consequences. The nurse will not notify the authorities unless there is evidence to suggest the adolescent is being harmed by his parent’s disciplinary actions.

The purpose of having the client “take five to revive” is to help him substitute a healthier way of dealing with his feelings. When the client is engaging in oppositional behavior, asking him if he is upset may further aggravate the situation.

Ensuring the safety of the client and others is the primary concern. The first action would be to ensure the safety of all concerned by separating the client from the other clients.

        "Choice 1": "1. Reassign the nurse to another unit with younger clients",
        "Choice 2": "2. Explain how aging does not prevent one from performing ADLs",
        "Choice 3": "3. Reprimand the nurse for charting opinions rather than facts",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The nursing supervisor nurse should explain how aging does not prevent one from performing ADL’s, thus, educating the young nurse regarding the differences between normal aging and problems associated with pathologic conditions. Reprimanding the nurse for charting opinions and reassigning the nurse to another unit does not dispel the myths about the aging process. Suggesting the nurse encourage the client to be more independent is not acting as an advocate for the needs of elders, nor does it address possible reasons for inability to perform activities of daily living.",

        "Choice 1": "1. “Better pharmacological treatments have increased the normal life span of individuals afflicted with mental illness.”",
        "Choice 2": "2. “Medicare coverage will pay for most mental health services provided to elders.”",
        "Choice 3": "3. “Most elders require frequent hospitalization due to chronic illness and mental disability.”",

        "Explanation": "Individuals with schizophrenia, dementia, and mood disorders, once associated with decreased longevity, are living longer as a consequence of improved pharmacologic and other treatments. Medicare covers only a small portion of mental health services and many long-term care facilities do not admit identified geropsychiatric clients. Unless they can no longer drive or live alone, approximately 95% of elders are living independently and contentedly in their own homes.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Going to a local restaurant for a nice meal, dancing, and social interaction represents the concepts of activity theory—that remaining active contributes to mental health and satisfaction in late life. Nutritional theory focuses on the quality of one’s diet to improve healthy aging, while environmental theory focuses on harmful substances and pollutants that could threaten health and cause undue stress. If the nurse was using nutritional and environmental theories, a healthy meal in a quiet, non-stressful environment would be planned. The wear-and-tear theory emphasizes loss and decline in later life due to cellular degeneration caused by abuse and lack of care.",

        "Choice 2": "2. “Depressed older adults may exhibit an excessive preoccupation with chronic constipation or pain.”",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Depressed older adults may feel they are supposed to feel sad or blue as they age; however, these are not normal aspects of the aging process. Depression may be exhibited in older adults by a preoccupation with physical symptoms such as chronic pain or constipation—called somatization. Loss of executive function such as the inability to sequence, organize, or abstract information as well as loss of interest and apathy may indicate depression in older adults.",

        "Explanation": "Buying a hand revolver presents the highest suicide potential because it signals a degree of premeditation and planning with a highly lethal means for completing suicide.

Additionally, elders are more vulnerable to the effects of alcohol and are the largest consumers of OTC and prescribed medications. Aggressive behavior and memory lapses are not normal responses to aging and may be signs of depression or dementia; however, further assessment is needed before any diagnosis can be made.

        "Choice 2": "2. “An herbal remedy such as melatonin can help us sleep better.”",

        "Explanation": "Shame and the fear of stigmatization may cause elders to be cautious and inhibit their ability to freely express feelings. More time may be needed with elders due to hearing loss, confusion, agitation, wandering, and communication problems. Information obtained from elders should also be validated with family and staff members to provide a complete picture; there is no reason to believe that these sources are inaccurate.

        "Explanation": "Transportation to doctor/nurse appointments or to the hospital is frequently an obstacle that older adults need help to overcome. Asking specific information regarding the amount of money a person has is an unnecessary invasion of privacy and may hinder the development of trust. Asking if the client forgets to pay bills or has problems with family members taking advantage of them are negative assumptions that can lead the older adult to suspect these events are occurring.

        "Explanation": "Leaving a confused elder unattended for long periods of time is a form of mistreatment. However, leaving a competent elder at the doctor’s office to await an appointment is not neglect or abandonment. Abrasions, sprains, and dislocations can be signs of coercion; however, most elders’ skin is very friable and skin tears are often the result of unintentionally hitting a sharp object.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The recent loss of his wife will almost certainly lead to ineffective role performance due to a change in social interaction and ability to manage on his own after 50 years of marriage. Social withdrawal, loneliness, and mental status changes can also occur due to lack of social stimulation. A risk for self-directed violence or suicide attempt would be a greater concern than violence directed toward others.

Pet therapy and social support groups are more commonly used with older adults who lack social supports or effective coping skills and do not restore balance.

        "Explanation": "Respite care allows the client to continue living at home while providing temporary relief from excessive burdens placed on the primary caregiver. Hospice care is available only if the client has a terminal illness and is expected to die within six months. Restorative care would not provide the wife with support while she is away from home and 24-hour care provided by long-term care facilities is not required in the early stages of this disease.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Encouraging the client to spend time with people her own age instead of trying to look and act younger reflects ageism—a bias against older people. Recognizing that demanding and dependent behaviors are symptomatic of depression and loneliness indicates an understanding that these behaviors are not a normal consequence of aging.

        "Explanation": "Medicare, the major form of health care financing for older adults, covers only a portion of the costs for long-term care needs. Medicare provides limited coverage of both inpatient and community mental health services. The Medicare Part D program provides options for older adults to minimize prescription costs but can be very difficult to understand.

        "Explanation": "Trusting and being trusted are intimately linked to risk-taking. The level of trust among the members of a group determines the extent of risk-taking behavior in the group. The group member who makes a suggestion, discloses an attitude, feeling, experience, or perception, gives feedback, or confronts another member engages in trusting behavior and assumes the risks inherent in trusting.

Others have written about the “true self” versus “the false self” or the “good me,” the “bad me,” and the “real me.” Common to all these concepts is the idea that self-awareness is a complex, multidimensional phenomenon, often contradictory and partly undiscovered. The Johari Awareness Model, often called simply the Johari Window, is a theoretical tool used to represent self-awareness and self-disclosure in relation to other people.

In the forming stage, members are reluctant to self-disclose until issues of confidentiality are understood. In the storming phase, communication is more open and authentic, but conflicts that erupt may cause reticence among members to disclose personal feelings.

In a family, each person’s behavior is contingent on and affects the behavior of the others. Family members’ behavior is not necessarily reflective of the client’s mental illness.

The family is not exhibiting pseudohostility in which there is chronic conflict, remoteness, or denial to negate hostility. Enmeshed families have diffuse boundaries.

Unfortunately, some mental health care professionals still have a bias against family involvement. This bias is a remnant of now-discredited theories that poor parenting and dysfunctional family interaction patterns give rise to mental illness. A related bias is the belief that if families “cause” schizophrenia, then the family’s contact with the client should be limited for the client’s sake. Besides violating family rights, this bias prevents social interaction with family members that might serve as a normalizing force by confronting clients with reality.

Stigma is one example of family burden. Other family burdens reported most often are financial strain, violence in the household, reductions in the physical and mental health of family caregivers, disruption of family routines, worry about the future, the mental health system itself as a stressor, and feeling overwhelmed or unable to cope.

Once these thoughts are identified, they are examined for their impact on the individual. Nurses are instrumental in helping a client see how a particular set of thoughts can create a problem. When this connection is made, substituting neutral or positive thoughts for the problematic thinking schema takes place over time.

An irrational belief is a belief that lacks reason and sound judgment. The clinician who is skilled in RET helps identify irrational thought structures with the client and then helps develop a plan to substitute more rational personal life philosophies and attitudes based on accurately perceived realities (Ellis, 1997).

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The basic rules for negotiating a behavioral contract include engaging the client as a colleague, avoiding complex terminology or coercive formats, and making sure the client completely understands, agrees to, and, to the extent possible, feels comfortable with the contract. The nurse’s condescending attitude will not encourage the client to ask questions. Complex or medical terminology will not help the client understand the contract.",

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "How people think and react and remember is their cognitive style or overall pattern of thought. The nurse’s actions indicate an understanding of the way the client thinks.

Cardiac arrest, seizures, and change in level of consciousness are late and life threatening signs that could be avoided if the early signs are recognized.

        "Explanation": "In order to promote adherence, the nurse should partner with the client and the client’s family. Telling the client that someone else knows what is best for the client is paternalistic and interferes with partnering with clients.

        "Explanation": "Sexual dysfunctions are frequent side effects of antidepressants and the client may be too embarrassed to initiate this discussion and quit taking the medication. Even though loss of libido may be a symptom of depression, it does not address the issue of the medication side effect. Cultural attitudes about sexual functioning are not directly related to the question.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The alcohol dependence must be a part of the client’s treatment plan or the client will likely not take the medication.

        "Explanation": "Akathisia is the inability to sit still for more than a few minutes or the feeling of not being able to sit still. It is a side effect of antipsychotic medication that can be very distressing to the client. The nurse should assess the patient to determine if she has akathisia.

Recreational and educational group attendance is a realistic and measurable goal for this environment and is most appropriate for the client with severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI). Identifying career goals and developing a resume is the focus of vocational rehabilitation programs. Obtaining support for basic needs such as food, clothing, and transportation is a goal for case management rather than clubhouse programs.

Supported employment is an approach that provides training and support in the workplace.

Most clients find that teaching others is an excellent way to incorporate meaningful information.

HIV disease is disproportionately prevalent among individuals already at the economic edge and those who are targets of discrimination in housing and medical care: people of color, homosexuals, injection drug users, and homeless and runaway youth. Although most people with an impaired immune system can live independently, they require a safe environment that helps them avoid exposure to infectious diseases, get adequate rest, meet their special nutritional needs, and have access to support services and home help when necessary.

        "Explanation": "The nurse should counsel clients to observe some cautions while carrying out this technique. To avoid soft tissue and spinal injury, the muscles of the neck and back should not be excessively tightened. Tightening the muscles of the toes and feet too vigorously could also result in uncomfortable muscle cramps. Clients with cardiac arrhythmias should be cautioned against vasovagal stimulation by tensing muscles too tightly.

The most promising beneficial effects of this experimental treatment are in clients with depression and hallucinating clients who are medication-resistant.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The technique of progressive relaxation is based on the premise that muscle tension is the body’s physiologic response to anxiety-provoking thoughts. Deep muscle relaxation, by contrast, decreases physiologic tension and blocks anxiety. Clients with insomnia and depression are among those who can achieve positive results using this technique. Alternate-nostril breathing is best for sinus headaches and is not intended for deep relaxation. Watching TV is not a relaxation technique. Medical meditation takes focus and although it may induce the relaxation response, for those who need to sleep it may stimulate alertness rather than encourage sleep.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Eye movement desensitization reprocessing is a controversial intervention suggested for PTSD and dissociative identity disorder. Clients are asked to recall traumatic memories or a feared stimulus while making a series of rapid lateral eye movements. There is no definitive theoretical explanation of how EMDR might work other than that it is the repetitive redirection of attention in EMDR that induces a neurobiologic state, similar to that of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, which assists in the integration of traumatic memories into the cortex of the brain. As with conventional medicine, there has been inaccurate and selective reporting of research, inadequately designed studies, and biased or inaccurate reviews. EMDR has been described as having a significant healing outcome for an adult with a childhood memory of medical trauma resulting from a tonsillectomy. However, a randomized clinical trial that compared the short- and long-term benefits of medication (fluoxetine) with those of EMDR in subjects diagnosed with PTSD found that 75% of adult-onset subjects at the six-month follow-up were asymptomatic compared with none in the fluoxetine group. EMDR is not used for treatment of depression or Bipolar I. For most childhood-onset trauma victims, neither medication nor EMDR produced complete symptom remission.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Alternate-nostril breathing stems from the practice of yoga and helps reduce tension and sinus headaches. Passive progressive relaxation is a technique to relax the muscles without tightening them first and is useful for muscle spasms, lower back pain, tension headaches, insomnia, and anxiety. Guided imagery takes too much focus to use when suffering from a sinus headache and, if attempting to practice at that time, may in fact worsen the sinus headache. Tai chi is a body-based CAM practice that requires specific education and practice. When learned and practice is maintained, it has shown to improve one’s sense of balance and is, therefore, useful as a health promotion and health maintenance tool rather than an adjunctive treatment for sinus headaches.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Clients often report they do not inform their primary care practitioner of CAM use, most frequently because they were not asked. Using therapeutic communication, such as an open-ended question asking what the client does to maintain or improve health, is more likely to initiate a conversation through which further information about complementary and alternative practices and products will be shared by the client with the nurse. Asking the client to provide details about medications or other products may be construed as threatening or judgmental. Asking if the client takes dietary supplements and herbs is closed-ended and implies a lack of freedom of choice on the part of the client.",

Depending upon client preferences, massage can be a beneficial stress management tool. Finger-holds for general well-being is a form of acupressure and has the potential to bring the anxious client into a moderate meditative state that is not so deep as to cause a vasovagal stimulation.

Assessing the client’s current emotional state and coping mechanisms that have been effective in the past require open-ended questions and attentive listening.

The original approach, known as critical incident stress debriefing, was intended to include four major elements—on-scene crisis intervention; post-incident small group discussion (known as defusing); a more formalized several-phase group discussion, which included debriefing; and follow-up support services. In practice, however, only one element, the group discussion, often to the exclusion of the others, became the focus of disaster mental health intervention. Its ease of use and the perception that it prevented PTSD led to its popularity.

Aggressive behavior violates the rights of others. Pacing and singing are disruptive to others but do not violate anyone else’s rights.

It is a bit premature to notify security until the nurse has determined that the client is nonresponsive to redirection, and this does not reinforce the element of respect in the nurse-client relationship. Telling the client that the behavior is inappropriate is paternalistic and the command sounds punitive, directly the opposite of what the client is demanding, which could provoke a negative response from the client.

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Haloperidol is a high-potency, short-acting antipsychotic that is useful in calming agitation. Lithium is a mood stabilizer and amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant; these drugs would be used for long-term management of mood symptoms. Methylphenidate, a psychostimulant, is relatively fast-acting but would not calm agitated behavior.",

        "Choice 1": "1. “You need to stop slamming your door and go down the hall to the group meeting.”",
        "Choice 2": "2. “How about taking a walk with me so we can find a place for you to let go of some of your nervous energy.”",
        "Choice 3": "3. “I can see that you have some excess energy that you need to get out, but you cannot continue to slam this door.”",
        "Choice 4": "4. “You seem upset, would you like some medication to help you with your agitation?”",
        "Choice 5": "5. “If you don’t stop slamming the door, I will lock it for the rest of the day.”",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "2, 3, 4",
        "Explanation": "“You need to stop slamming your door and go down the hall to the group meeting.” Attending group is not a priority for a client who is demonstrating agitated behavior.",

        "Question": "A client was admitted for psychosis and aggressive behavior. The client has been noncompliant with the antipsychotic medication because the client says it makes the client’s jaw tight and neck stiff. The client is becoming increasingly agitated and needs a quick-acting medication. Which medication would the nurse expect to give?",
        "Choice 1": "1. Benztropine (Cogentin)",
        "Choice 2": "2. Fluphenazine (Prolixin)",
        "Choice 3": "3. Risperidone (Risperdal)",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "An antipsychotic is the treatment for acute agitation. Zolpidem and benztropine are not antipsychotics. Given the client’s prior symptoms of dystonia, it would be appropriate to try an atypical antipsychotic (risperidone) over the conventional (fluphenazine).",

        "Choice 1": "1. The nurse lacks rapport with the client.",
        "Choice 2": "2. The nurse lacks adequate de-escalation and limit setting skills.",
        "Choice 3": "3. Some clients have limited control, so verbal interventions may not work, but this is not reflective of the nurse’s skill.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Not all clients will respond to verbal interventions, but this does not mean the nurse lacks skill. The nurse should always follow the principle of least restrictive measures first, even if it does not appear that it may work. A nurse’s verbal skills or ability to establish rapport are not necessarily measured by the client’s response, as some clients are more out of control than others.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The client’s thought process is preventing the client from receiving any benefit from group and could escalate if not properly attended to. In this scenario, it is not appropriate for the client to remain in the group, and the behavior must be addressed prior to asking the group for input.

Repeated attempts by the nurse to orient the client to reality and reassure the client of safety have failed. What would be the nurse’s next de-escalation approach?",
        "Choice 1": "1. Offer the client a PRN medication",
        "Choice 2": "2. Apply soft limb restraints on client’s wrists",
        "Choice 3": "3. Have several staff demobilize the client so that forcible injection can be administered",
        "Choice 4": "4. Call security to assist in placing the client in seclusion",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Offering the client a PRN medication would be the next step as attempts at verbal de-escalation have failed. Restraints are the most restrictive intervention and not warranted at this point. Seclusion will not prevent the client from self-harm inflicted by beating the walls. Forcing medication is a chemical restraint and not warranted until voluntary medication has been refused.",

        "Question": "A client has been placed in seclusion. Which client behavior would have warranted this intervention?",
        "Choice 1": "1. The client is manic, has been flirtatious towards staff and refused morning medication, and has verbalized a plan to leave",
        "Choice 2": "2. The client is psychotic, sits in the corner with hands over ears, and displays increased suspiciousness of and agitation towards others despite recently receiving 1mg risperidone (Risperdal) PRN",
        "Choice 3": "3. The client is depressed and wants to be left alone to rest",
        "Choice 4": "4. The client is suicidal, has been banging head against the table in the day room, and was unresponsive to staff’s verbal redirection",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The scientific rationale for the use of seclusion is based on three principles: containment, isolation, and decrease in sensory input. This client exhibits behavior that suggests increased sensitivity to the environment and risk of harm to others. A less restrictive measure has been tried (medication) without success. Seclusion should not be used as punishment for inappropriate behavior or to prevent client elopement. Seclusion is inappropriate when a client is engaging in self-injurious behavior that could continue in the seclusion environment (head-banging); in such circumstances a 1:1 staffing or restraints may be necessary. If a client seeks isolation voluntarily, seclusion (locking the door) is not warranted.",

        "Choice 1": "1. Move the other clients away from the area providing the client privacy to continue the conversation.",
        "Choice 2": "2. Stand next to the client and say in a calm, firm voice, “If you cannot lower your voice, you will lose your phone privileges indefinitely.”",
        "Choice 3": "3. Walk up to the client and softly say, “This conversation appears to be getting you upset, tell this person that you will talk later and come sit with me to discuss what is bothering you.”",
        "Choice 4": "4. Do nothing. The client does not pose any danger as the person the client is angry with is not physically present.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "An underlying goal of initial efforts at de-escalation is to assist the client in getting away from the aversive stimulus and to assess his or her ability to regain control. Encroaching upon the client’s physical space and making a demand could escalate the aggression level; moreover, no rights can be restricted indefinitely.

Based on behavioral theory, the nurse would suspect that the child’s aggressive behavior could best be reduced by:",
        "Choice 1": "1. Administering a medication that will increase the neurotransmitter serotonin.",
        "Choice 2": "2. Engaging the client and sister in family therapy.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Behavioral theory asserts that aggressive behavior is a learned response that tends to be repeated if reinforced. Watching violent TV programs serves as reinforcement. Lack of reinforcement or reinforcing other more desirable behaviors will help extinguish the aggressive behavior. Administration of medication suggests neurotransmitter abnormality as the origin for aggression supporting a biological, not behavioral, etiology. Thought reframing is a cognitive intervention used when it is believed that aggression stems from an individual’s negative or distorted thought process. Interpersonal theorists pose that violence stems from poor family dynamics and recommend family therapy as an intervention.",

        "Question": "An inpatient psychiatric unit has been operating at an unusually high acuity level over the past week resulting in numerous incidents of seclusion or restraint. A review of each violent event reveals that appropriate crisis management strategies were implemented and unit policy followed. What action is most appropriate?",
        "Choice 1": "1. No action is necessary; the staff is following policy appropriately.",
        "Choice 2": "2. Create a rotating schedule to allow staff to leave the unit for frequent brief breaks to alleviate stress.",
        "Choice 3": "3. Identify the characteristics of the aggressive clients so that admission criteria can be adjusted to reduce risk of violence.",
        "Choice 4": "4. Have an expert speak to staff about seclusion and restraint reduction strategies.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "It is highly likely that staff members are experiencing an increased amount of stress given the high client acuity, so frequent breaks will enable staff to meet personal needs and continue to perform effectively. Taking no action ignores that staff have been operating under conditions that are more stressful than usual and may need supportive measures to cope with the increased job stress. Correct crisis management strategies were followed suggesting that seclusion and restraint interventions were warranted and could not be reduced or prevented. Having an expert speak about reduction at this time could imply that staff did not perform appropriately, which is not the case. Clients with a high risk for violence need treatment, therefore, admission criteria should not be altered to prevent such clients’ access to treatment.",

        "Choice 2": "2. Accept the fear, process the event with other staff, and continue working with the client.",

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Experiencing fear is normal; understanding is critical and enhanced by processing the event with others who were involved.
