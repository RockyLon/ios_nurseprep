For example, when interviewing a newly admitted patient with diabetes, the nurse asks, “What time do you take your insulin?” A specific question with a specific answer is a typical closed question, which generally requires only one or two words in response."

        "Explanation": "Eye contact is responsible for much communication and much miscommunication. Generally, making eye contact communicates an intention to interact.

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 2, 3, 4",
        "Explanation": "Listening is sometimes active and sometimes passive. Active listening requires full attention to what the patient is saying. The message is heard, its meaning is interpreted, and the patient is given feedback, indicating understanding of the message. Verbally interpreting the meaning of what the patient has said is an example of active listening. In passive listening, the nurse indicates that they are listening to what the patient is saying either nonverbally, through eye contact and nodding, or verbally through encouraging phrases such as “Uh-huh” and “I see.” All of the other options are examples of passive listening."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 4, 5, 6",
        "Explanation": "Touch is a form of nonverbal communication that is inherent in the practice of nursing. Nearly every nursing intervention for the purpose of providing physical care calls for touch. Touch is frequently highly personal or of an intimate nature (e.g., giving a bed bath, assisting a patient on or off a bedpan, inserting a urinary catheter). Because of the intimate nature of touch in the nursing context, it is necessary to use it with great discretion to fit into sociocultural norms and guidelines. Some nurses are uncomfortable with touch because of a fear of it seeming inappropriate or being misinterpreted. When a nurse feels comfortable with physical contact with a patient, touch has great potential for conveying warmth, caring, support, and understanding. For the nurse to convey warmth, it is absolutely necessary for the nature of their touch to be sincere and genuine."

        "Choice 6": "Purposeful use of silence often conveys lack of respect.",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 3, 4, 5",
        "Explanation": "Maintaining silence is an extremely effective therapeutic communication technique, and yet tends to be quite underused. Because silence often feels awkward in American society, people tend to feel the need to “fill” it. This impulse does not always allow the people involved in an interaction time to organize their thoughts sufficiently to communicate what they would like. It is common for a person to need several seconds after hearing a verbal message to interpret what has been stated and to formulate the most appropriate response. Unfortunately, the receiver often does not get this amount of time before a response is necessary. In many cases, the sender becomes uncomfortable with the silence and begins speaking again before the receiver has had an opportunity to formulate a response and is really ready to deliver it. The ability to use silence effectively requires skill and timing. It is easy for prolonged periods of misunderstood silence to cause uneasiness and tension. However, in many cases, purposeful use of silence conveys respect, understanding, caring, and support, and it is often used in conjunction with therapeutic touch."

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Although all of these options are good, to determine whether practice is serving the needs of the population, the nurse will need to consult the population served. This means that evidence should be applied with input from the community. For example, decisions related to the services to be offered in a nurse-managed clinic should be made with input from the clinic’s advisory board, which should include community leaders and consumers of the clinic’s services. Cuban immigrant needs may not be the same as those of Hispanic immigrants from other places such as Mexico or Spain."

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Research findings, knowledge from basic science, clinical knowledge, and expert opinion should be considered sources of evidence for EBP. The problem with nursing textbooks is that many are not grounded in evidence-based practice, because the concept is relatively new to the United States (as mentioned in the section of the chapter on historical perspectives of EBP). Scanning the Internet for ideas is helpful only if evidence-based practice sites are accessed, and most Internet sites are not EBP sites."

        "Explanation": "The first step of the seven-step EBP process is step zero, which involves a curiosity about the interventions that are being applied; this is not described in any of the topic descriptors. Step one requires asking questions in a “PICOT” format; this is not described in any of the topic descriptors. Step two involves searching for the best evidence to answer the question.

        "Explanation": "The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) reviewed 40 systems used to evaluate the quality of studies and strength of evidence. The report identified three domains for evaluating systems that grade the strength of evidence: quality, quantity, and consistency. The quality of a study refers to the extent to which bias is minimized. Quantity refers to the number of studies, the magnitude of the effect, and the sample size. Consistency refers to studies that have similar findings, using similar and different study designs."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The first step toward implementing evidence-based practice in nursing is recognizing the current status of one’s own practice and believing that care based on the best evidence will lead to improved client outcomes. The challenge for the clinician is how to access the evidence and integrate it into practice, thus moving beyond practice based solely on experience, tradition, or ritual."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "EBP cannot be applied as a universal remedy without attention to client differences. When EBP is applied at the community level, best evidence may point to a solution that is not sensitive to cultural issues and distinctions and thus may not be acceptable to the community. For example, computer games may be excellent for younger groups but are often poorly suited for older Americans who may face challenges with learning new technology."

        "Explanation": "EBP in community-oriented nursing challenges nurses to integrate outcomes of the best evidence into their clinical practice. Current research findings will explicate evidence of most successful interventions. (Randomized clinical trials are the gold standard of research for EBP.) Protocols and opinions often reflect tradition rather than the most current scientific evidence. Although many nursing journals are peer reviewed, many are not and, even if peer reviewed, many are not research based or focused on scientific evidence. Similarly, information from the Internet may or may not be reliable, because the goal of many websites is to sell products rather than to serve as an unbiased source.

        "Choice 1": "Cues to action are an important component of the model.",
        "Choice 2": "Multiple methods of education should be used when implementing this model.",

        "Explanation": "The Health Belief Model includes six components that attempt to answer the question of what motivates an individual to do something. These components are perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, cues to action, and self-efficacy. The pre-contemplation stage is part of the Transtheoretical Model. Maintenance is part of the Precaution Adoption Process Model."

The educator determines how content can be tailored to the learner. The educator determines the objectives. If evaluation reveals that the learning objectives are not being met, the nurse must determine why the instruction is not effective.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "A task function is anything a member does that deliberately contributes to the group’s purpose. Members with task-directed abilities are attractive to the group. These traits include strong problem-solving skills, access to material resources, and skills in directing. The teenager’s statement shared information about a good resource for the group."

        "Explanation": "All the responses are empathetic and supportive. However, during the first phase, potential participants do not know whether they can trust one another. The primary task of the leader at this point is to clarify the purpose. Even though a statement such as “Don’t share anything until you’re comfortable” is supportive, the response explaining that “the purpose is to have a safe place” both recognizes what was said and clarifies the purpose of the group."

        "Question": "A nurse established an ongoing group meeting of teenagers with diabetes. In the early stages, the nurse was very directive in arranging location, providing low-carbohydrate drinks and snacks, steering the discussion, and trying to meet all the teenagers’ needs. After the group had been meeting for about 3 months, the nurse noticed that the group members no longer simply accepted everything the nurse suggested. Instead, the teenagers began making decisions themselves, and eventually, the nurse no longer controlled the group. Which of the following most likely happened to cause this shift?",
        "Choice 1": "The group became cohesive enough to share leadership tasks.",
        "Choice 2": "Teenagers don’t like feeling dependent on adults with power.",
        "Choice 3": "Teenagers often rebel against adult authority.",
        "Choice 4": "The nurse was overwhelmed and lost control of task process.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "In the beginning, the nurse used an authoritarian style because the nurse was responsible for the group direction. However, as the group matured, continuing an authoritarian style would have resulted in low morale and lack of cohesion. After a group is well established, nurses may best facilitate leadership by relinquishing central control and encouraging group members themselves to determine the norms for their group."

        "Choice 1": "Admit that it is difficult for everyone to agree on everything; then ask whether the group can try to decide how to agree on the issue.",
        "Choice 2": "Assume adult authority and announce that meetings will be suspended until fall.",
        "Choice 3": "Recognize that most of the teenagers want to have the meetings, but two are being stubborn; ask the two deviant members to leave the group.",
        "Choice 4": "Suggest that the group avoid discussing it further but rather think about it over the next week and try to discuss the situation more rationally next week.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "When you respond to conflict by avoiding (suggesting that they avoid further discussion), forcing with power (assuming adult authority), capitulating, or excluding some members (asking the deviant members to leave), the behavior fails to satisfy the concerns of those involved. Open communication and recognition that conflict is inevitable may allow the group to focus on a procedure for fairly resolving the conflict."

The objective that 95% of children will be immunized by 1 year does not precisely state which children (in a county? in the country?) and does not state which immunizations.

Change agent roles stress gathering and analyzing facts and implementing programs, whereas change partner roles include those of enabler-catalyst, teacher of problem-solving skills, and activist advocate. The nurse establishing an elder-care center is acting as a change agent. The nurses administering vaccinations and analyzing community problems are carrying out other nursing roles."

        "Explanation": "Not all communities are open to change. Ability to change is often related to the extent to which a community focuses on traditional norms. The more traditional the community, the less likely it is to change. The ability to change is often directly related to higher socioeconomic status; a perceived need for change; the presence of liberal, scientific, and democratic values; and a high level of social participation by community residents."

        "Explanation": "The status of community health involving physical indicators is often measured by traditional morbidity and mortality rates, life-expectancy indices, and risk-factor profiles. Vital statistics are measures of community health status. Health care manpower (e.g., nurses, physicians) and health facilities (e.g., hospitals, clinics) are measures of community health structure. Community awareness is a measure of the process."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 2",
        "Explanation": "Gaining entry or acceptance into the community is perhaps the biggest challenge in assessment. The nurse is usually an outsider and often represents an established health care system that is neither known nor trusted by community members, who may therefore react with indifference or even active hostility. Entry into the community is critical. Often the nurse can gain entry by taking part in community events, visiting people in formal leadership positions, and clarifying community members’ perceptions of health needs. While an activity such as volunteering is a positive action, it is not the most efficient way to become involved in the wider community."

        "Explanation": "Triage is the process of separating casualties and allocating treatment on the basis of the victims’ potentials for survival. The nurse will determine how seriously hurt individuals are and who should get care first, with the first priority being those who have life-threatening injuries but will probably survive if treated quickly. Although the textbook does not address the issue, because of the limited resources in a disaster situation and the fact that only the nurse is currently available to give care, seriously hurt individuals with head or chest injuries that have only a small chance of surviving are not treated."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Lack of information or inaccurate information regarding the scope of the disaster and its initial effects can contribute to the misuse of resources. Often too many volunteers who lack official sponsorship convene at the site of disaster and are disappointed when their help cannot be used. Similarly, well-meaning people may send clothes and food to disaster sites. The unneeded contributions of food and clothing add to the stress of coping with the disaster, particularly if refrigeration and storage are not available.

        "Choice 1": "Explain that the headache and problems focusing are probably the result of worry, so he should concentrate on the work at hand and deal with emotions later.",

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Symptoms of early stress and burnout include minor tremors, nausea, inability to concentrate, difficulty thinking, and problems with memory. Suppressing feelings of guilt, powerlessness, anger, and other signs of stress eventually will lead to symptoms such as irritability, fatigue, headaches, and distortions of bodily functions. It is normal to experience stress, but it must be addressed. The worst thing anyone can do is to deny that it exists.

        "Choice 2": "The nurse gives a presentation at the local college about the disaster and describes how health professionals were able to assist the victims who were injured.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "It is understandable that the nurse would return exhausted and moody. Indeed, concerns of major importance to family members may seem trivial when compared with problems the disaster victims were confronting. However, the fact that the nurse needs to continue to ventilate about the disaster, even after the family has quit listening, would suggest a delayed stress reaction that is not resolving and therefore warrants professional intervention."

In active surveillance, the health department nurse may begin a search for cases through contacts to determine the magnitude of the problem. Sentinel surveillance involves looking for trends. Special surveillance is developed when a particular type of data is sought."

        "Choice 1": "No further action is necessary because depression is known to worsen during the shorter darker days of winter.",
        "Choice 2": "No further action is necessary because this short-term increase may just be a statistical error or even just a mistaken impression by the involved nurses.",
        "Choice 3": "Action should be taken because there must be some cause for this noted increase.",

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "2, 4",
        "Explanation": "Doctors feeling rushed and nurses calling in ill are not unusual events. Syndronic surveillance systems were developed to monitor illness syndromes or events, as seen in such indirect measures as increased numbers of medication purchases, trips to physicians or emergency departments, orders for cultures or x-rays, and rising levels of school or work absenteeism.

It should answer the following questions: Are the needs for which the program was designed being met? Are the problems it was designed to solve being solved? If the program does not achieve the purpose for which it is designed, important concerns of satisfaction and cost are irrelevant.

The provider service record is completed on a daily basis by each provider and is summarized monthly and annually to indicate trends in health care activities and costs relative to personnel time, transportation, maintenance, and supplies. A clinical record is the client health record. This would contain health information for a single client, would not generally include clinic costs, and would be an inefficient source because it identifies service to only one individual.

It is not realistic to expect the whole family to change eating patterns immediately based on the needs of one family member. However, if family members are supportive, they will want to try to help the ill member. Because of the rapid change and stress in American society, preparing different sets of meals is not very realistic.

Also, more family members can be present, and families are often more comfortable in their own environment. However, a disadvantage to meeting in the family’s home is that family members may view this as an intrusion into the only place they feel safe from outside observation; thus, the nurse must be highly skilled in guiding the interactions and setting limits."

It can be assumed that the nurse would already know agency policies. It is more informative to interview the family as a whole so that you can observe family interaction (rather than focusing on interviewing each individual).

        "Choice 1": "“Be sure to take a 30-minute walk each day.”",
        "Choice 2": "“Call our office if you have any questions or concerns at all.”",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The factors that determine or influence whether disease or other unhealthy results occur are called health risks. The major categories of risk include inherited biological risk, social and physical environmental risk, and behavioral risk. All the other options are treatment oriented rather than risk avoidance. Exercising for 30 minutes a day reduces the risk for many diseases."

        "Explanation": "Health risk appraisal refers to the process of assessing for the presence of specific factors in each of the categories that have been identified as being associated with an increased likelihood of an illness, such as cancer, or an unhealthy event, such as an automobile accident. Therefore, the nurse would assess for unhealthy behavior and activities in the areas of biological and age-related risk, social and physical environment risk, and behavioral risk. Activities to promote health, prevent illness, or reduce risks would be advantageous, not risky."

        "Question": "A nurse is implementing risk reduction interventions with a family. Which of the following questions is most important for the nurse to ask?",
        "Choice 1": "“Did any of the hunters in your family kill a deer this year?”",
        "Choice 2": "“How do you keep your rifles safe from curious children?”",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Risk reduction is a complex process that requires knowledge of risks and families’ perceptions of the nature of the risk. In this situation the nurse was asking questions to determine the family’s perception of risks associated with owning guns. If the family does not perceive the behavior (having guns in the house) as risky, but rather as necessary for food or sport, the nurse must first educate or persuade the family that others may be more comfortable if certain precautionary measures are taken (such as locks on the guns). Rifles are used for food and sport but handguns are often used in crimes and accidents resulting in death."

        "Choice 2": "“My husband always handled our finances. Now that he’s gone, I’ll have to learn how to do this.”",

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "A family crisis occurs when the family is not able to cope with an event and becomes disorganized or dysfunctional. When the demands of the situation exceed the resources of the family, a family crisis exists. In three of the options, the survivor is considering the problem and trying to learn how to cope or seek resources to cope. Only in this option is the person overwhelmed and unable to conceive of how to cope."

        "Choice 2": "Newlyweds who have been saving their money, who want to discuss birth control and family planning in preparation for future pregnancies.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Transitions (movement from one stage or condition to another) are times of potential risk for families. Age-related or life-event risks often occur during transitions from one developmental stage to another. Transitions present new situations and demands for families. Moving from the family home to a smaller condo represents a major change in lifestyle. None of the other options represent major transitions. If the event is normative, or anticipated, it is possible for families to prepare for the event and its consequences."

        "Explanation": "Life events can increase the risk for illness and disability. Normative events are those that are generally expected to occur at a particular stage of development or of the life span. Although pregnancy is a normal condition, it carries risks such as the development of\r\neclampsia or more minor health problems such as constipation and hemorrhoids. Additionally, pregnancy (and the birth that follows) will alter family dynamics and may increase risk for psychological stressors. The events listed in the other options are not normative life events."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Genomic health care can give health care providers the tools that they need to use a person’s unique genomic information to design and prescribe the most effective treatment for each person and to help clients and families understand some of their health risks that are influenced by their genetic make-up. When nurses obtain a family history and learn about the illnesses and causes of death of biologically related family members, they can then learn about shared genes, environment and lifestyle behaviors that can increase a person’s risks for the same diseases that other family members experienced. Genomic health care is broader than detecting risk for developing cancer."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "A person who is unemployed and despairing of finding employment is at serious economic risk, which is one of the foremost predictors of health problems. Economic risk is determined by the relationship between family financial resources and the demands on those resources. Having adequate financial resources means that a family is able to purchase the necessary services and goods related to health, such as adequate housing, clothing, food, education, and health or illness care."

        "Choice 1": "To assess the family’s environment and social resources and risks",
        "Choice 2": "To communicate with relevant others as needed",
        "Choice 3": "To determine financial assets available to the family in case of serious need",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The question by the nurse indicates that she is trying to obtain an ecomap. Ecomaps can provide information about relationships that the family has with others (such as relatives and neighbors), the family’s connections with other social units (such as church, school, work, clubs, and organizations), and the flow of energy, positive or negative, in the family. An ecomap represents the family’s interactions with other groups and organizations. Environmental or social risk and resources can be assessed from an ecomap."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Personal health habits continue to contribute to the major causes of morbidity and mortality. The pattern of personal health habits and behavioral risk defines individual and family lifestyle risk. The client who doesn’t move from the computer desk is creating great stress and strain on personal physiology and needs to be educated on the benefits of exercise and the risks of cumulative trauma on the body. Multiple health benefits of regular physical activity have been identified; regular physical exercise is effective in promoting and maintaining health and preventing disease."

Regular physical exercise is effective in promoting and maintaining health and in preventing disease. Physical activity can help to prevent obesity, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, osteoporosis, and depression. Avoidance of alcohol and daily consumption of calcium-rich foods are not recommendations for improving personal health habits."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Personal safety is an issue. Home visits are generally very safe; however, as with all worksites, the possibility of violence exists.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "With the exception of social interaction, all the tasks listed are important. The initial home visit includes the nurse’s self-identification and clarification of role, establishing rapport with the family, assessing the situation, and then determining the client’s expectations. Although in some senses the nurse is a guest in the home, the nurse is not there for social purposes but to help the family with health concerns. However, without rapport between the nurse and the client, the nurse will be notably less effective at other tasks."

        "Explanation": "Advantages of a home visit include client convenience and client control, as well as the fact that it facilitates clients who are unable to travel, it allows more individualized services, and it provides a natural relaxed environment for discussion. However, home visits are expensive for the nurse and the nurse’s employer because of travel costs and the amount of time spent with just one family.

        "Answer": "1, 2, 4",
        "Explanation": "Although it is not unusual to have only one home visit with a family, often multiple visits are made. The frequency and intensity of home visits vary not only with the needs of the family but also with the eligibility of the family for services as defined by agency policies and priorities. Although the textbook does not directly discuss the issue, the family’s willingness to work with the nurse is a factor. Also, the nurse cannot make visits unless the agency is being reimbursed for the nurse’s time and expenses, so reimbursement policies of third-party payers are a major influence on the number of visits for which the family may be eligible. The nurse’s perception of the time needed to give quality care must unfortunately be secondary to other variables, which can control the time available."

Which of the following must be remembered throughout this process? (Select all that apply.)",
        "Choice 1": "A reassessment of resources should be done if the plan does not work.",
        "Choice 2": "Individual family members must all be willing to make the plan their first priority.",
        "Choice 3": "Goals must be realistic and feasible.",
        "Choice 4": "Ongoing negotiation is central to the process.",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "3, 4",
        "Explanation": "In contracting, an important aspect is obtaining the family’s view of the situation and its needs and problems. Goals must be mutually set and realistic. A pitfall for nurses and clients who are new to contracting is to set overly ambitious goals. Because contracting is a process characterized by ongoing renegotiating, the goals are not static. The family’s inability to change “as easily and quickly as they had hoped” does not mean the plan is not workable—only that more time and effort may be necessary."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "3, 4",
        "Explanation": "With chronic illness, the focus is on healing (a unique process resulting in a shift in the body/mind/spirit system) rather than curing (elimination of the signs and symptoms of disease). Appropriate goals include maximizing self-care capacity, managing chronic diseases effectively, preventing complications, delaying deterioration and decline, and achieving the highest possible quality of life before dying with comfort, peace, and dignity."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Vulnerability can be reversed by obtaining resources to increase resilience. Although money, food, and clothing meet needs for the short term, they do not help the immigrant develop the power and control to improve health risks over the long term or contribute to lasting resilience. Learning the basic language of the country of residence will give immigrants the ability to communicate and navigate through systems and thus remove barriers that promote disenfranchisement and disadvantaged status."

        "Choice 4": "Short length of time in the community",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Disenfranchisement refers to a feeling of separation from mainstream society. The person does not seem to have an emotional connection with any group in particular or the larger society. For migrant workers who are frequently moving, the short length of time they stay in the community does not allow for the development of social ties. Being a minority group member would not by itself cause disenfranchisement if the minority group member lived in a community with persons from similar ethnic and cultural backgrounds."

        "Answer": "4",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 had some shifts in payment with the stipulations related to home health. In an attempt to curb the rapid growth in spending on home health and financial fraud in that industry, the Health Care Financing Administration (now the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services [CMS]) instituted prospective payment for home health services. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 was intended to help people keep their health insurance when moving from one place to another as well as provide privacy and security of personal health information. The State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) was created by Title XXI of the Social Security Act in 1998."

        "Choice 1": "Begin tests to determine the cause of the bleeding while asking about other family concerns from nutrition to shelter for the night.",
        "Choice 2": "Refer the man to a urologist to address the urinary bleeding.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "It is important to provide comprehensive, family-centered, “one-stop” services. Providing multiple services during a single clinic visit is an example of one-stop services. If social and economic assistance are provided and included in interdisciplinary treatment plans, services can be more responsive to the combined effects of social and economic stressors on the health of special population groups."

        "Choice 1": "At the city’s homeless shelter, which is, by policy, vacant during the day",
        "Choice 2": "At a large medical center, where the students could get permission to use an empty clinic in the evening",
        "Choice 3": "At the largest inner-city police station, where there was a large empty space available",
        "Choice 4": "At the local community college, where there are plenty of tables and chairs",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Homeless persons would probably avoid the police station, and many may not wish to go to the medical center—also, there would be transportation issues. The most convenient place for the clients would be the homeless shelter, where transportation and lack of comfort in an unfamiliar place would not be issues. It is helpful to provide comprehensive services in locations where people live and work, including schools, churches, neighborhoods, and workplaces. Thus, for the homeless population the homeless shelter would be an appropriate location."

        "Choice 1": "A bill that establishes policies requiring all persons to pay the same cost for services regardless of income",
        "Choice 2": "A bill that promotes universal health insurance coverage",
        "Choice 3": "A bill that requires all health care providers to give care to uninsured persons without charge",
        "Choice 4": "A bill that requires health care workers to report undocumented immigrants who present for treatment",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Requiring health care professionals to give care to uninsured persons without charge would quickly bankrupt hospitals, and health professionals could not afford to continue in those roles. Such a law is unfeasible. Social justice refers to providing humane care and social supports for the most disadvantaged members of society. Nurses can be advocates for policy changes to improve social, economic, and environmental factors that predispose vulnerable populations to poor health. Many people do not have health insurance, particularly those who work in jobs where insurance is not offered or costs are too high. Promoting universal health insurance for all would be a step toward providing humane care for those who might not otherwise be able to receive care."

The nurse provides counseling, refers the client to an endocrinologist for initial assessment and treatment, arranges for the client to see someone regarding financial assistance, contacts the mobile van to arrange transportation, and sets up a follow-up appointment. Which of the following types of service do these actions represent?",

        "Choice 4": "Wrap-around services",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Nurses often function as case managers for vulnerable clients, making referrals and linking them with community services. Case management services are especially important for vulnerable persons because they often do not have the ability or resources to make their own arrangements. Linking clients with health services is accomplished by making appropriate referrals and by following up with clients to ensure that the desired outcomes from the referral were achieved."

        "Answer": "2",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Assumptions are not helpful. Each person and family should be assessed individually. No two people or groups are alike. Any stereotype, positive or negative, can be problematic. Even though Hispanic groups, as a whole, do have close-knit family structures, by assuming that all Hispanics are this way, staff members are less likely to be open to the possibility of issues such as family violence."

        "Choice 1": "Call all homeless clients 48 hours after TB skin testing to remind them to return to the clinic for test interpretation.",
        "Choice 2": "Have homeless individuals read their TB skin test, if necessary, and mail in results on a postage-paid card coded to protect privacy.",

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Homeless people often do not have a way to receive telephone calls. Additionally, they usually face numerous barriers to return to the clinic. These issues often require deviation from strict policies, especially strict policies that are not working. Nurses should develop a way for homeless individuals to read their TB skin test, if necessary, and give them a self-addressed, stamped card they can return by mail with the results."

        "Explanation": "Case management is a process that enhances continuity and appropriateness of care. When using case management with vulnerable populations, the nurse can be of greatest benefit if he or she is willing to develop long-term relationships with the families served. This increases trust as well as continuity of care. Care involves a partnership between nurse and client. Nurses who direct and control the client’s care cannot establish a trusting relationship and may inadvertently foster a cycle of dependency and lack of personal health control."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 3",
        "Explanation": "Because poverty is a primary cause of vulnerability, the nurse should include questions about the client’s financial status. Nurses should not provide financial or legal advice; however, they should make sure to connect clients with someone who can and will help them. Although an assessment must be done, a nurse should only collect data that will actually be used.

Not all migrant farmworkers are immigrants."

        "Question": "An employer provides a migrant farm family the day off to visit the health clinic in a nearby community and tells them to take all of the time they need. However, the family arrives at the clinic appearing very stressed. In addition to the health issue, which of the following would most likely be a fear experienced by the family?",
        "Choice 1": "Their personal belongings may be stolen while they are at the clinic.",
        "Choice 2": "Immigration officials will send them back to their home country.",
        "Choice 3": "The clinic personnel will look down on them and be biased against them.",

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Any of the answers might be true; however, most migrant farmworkers are legal residents or U.S. citizens, not illegal immigrants. Many do not have their own transportation and must rely on friends. Migrant farmworkers often have an unpredictable and difficult lifestyle. Many must leave home each year and travel to distant locations to work. They may be uncertain about their work and housing as they go from one possible job to another. An employer telling them to “take all the time they want” could be interpreted as meaning they may no longer be needed, and their next job may be very uncertain."

The nurse explains the danger signs and stresses staying cool and drinking lots of water. The man seems to know this already. Which of the following best describes the most likely reason that this happened?",
        "Choice 1": "It was a rare occurrence, which probably won’t be repeated.",
        "Choice 2": "The daughter either disobeyed her father and went out to play in the sun or just did not realize how hot she was.",

        "Choice 1": "Avoiding touching the client except when necessary as part of the physical examination",
        "Choice 2": "Calling the client by name, socializing before addressing the problem, and being very respectful",
        "Choice 3": "Keeping all interactions direct, to the point, and targeted on the reason for presentation",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The nurse is considered an authority figure who should respect (respeto) the individual, be able to relate to the individual (personalismo), and maintain the individual's dignity (dignidad). Such an approach would be expected for any client, not just with immigrants. Mexican individuals, like those of many cultures, expect to establish some rapport through talking about personal matters (chit-chat) for the first few minutes of an encounter before addressing any problems. Touching as a caring gesture is usually seen as a positive behavior."

        "Choice 1": "Increased interaction among residents due to neighbors visiting neighbors on the family farms",
        "Choice 2": "Involvement in rural community activities provides more contact with community residents than in urban areas",
        "Choice 3": "Nursing responsibilities in these areas stress the importance of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Rural areas have fewer churches, stores, and schools. Thus, nurses may go to the same church, shop at the same stores, and/or have children in the same schools as their clients. There are also fewer organizations, so it is easier to become involved and meet everyone while participating. Visiting neighbors does not increase opportunities for teaching. The fact that nursing responsibilities include all levels of prevention is true of both urban and rural areas. The statement about increased illness and injuries in rural residents is wrong, because although illnesses and injuries are increased, rural residents often do not seek care for these conditions."

        "Choice 1": "About 25% of all U.S. residents live in rural settings.",
        "Choice 2": "People in rural areas are especially susceptible to acute illnesses rather than chronic diseases.",

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 4",
        "Explanation": "About 25% of all U.S. residents live in rural settings. Rural residents are less likely to engage in preventive behavior and they tend to be poorer than their urban counterparts (more than 25% of rural Americans live in or near poverty, and nearly 40% of all rural children are impoverished). Nearly one half of all rural adults suffer from at least one chronic condition. Stress, stress-related conditions, and mental illness are prevalent among populations that have economic difficulties, including rural populations. Often rural health professionals live and practice in a particular community for decades. Consequently, rural respondents tend to know their usual provider of health care."

        "Answer": "2, 3",
        "Explanation": "Poor quality and crowded housing can contribute to such health problems as tuberculosis (TB), gastroenteritis, and hepatitis, as well as exposure to high levels of lead. Tuberculosis (TB) is more prevalent in Mexico than in the United States, and some infected immigrants work as migrant farmworkers.

Which of the following suggestions would the nursing supervisor provide to the nurse? (Select all that apply.)",
        "Choice 1": "“Community members will probably hold you in higher regard and will look up to you.”",
        "Choice 2": "“Expect to have less autonomy in a small town than you have working as a nurse in a medical center.”",
        "Choice 3": "“You may feel like an isolated outsider, because the community may not immediately accept you.”",

        "Explanation": "Nurses working in rural areas usually have a prestigious status in the community and are viewed as role models. They have greater (not less) independence and autonomy, fewer (not more) resources, and need to have more generalist (not specialized) knowledge and skills."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 2, 3",
        "Explanation": "Rural people often develop independent and creative ways to cope because of the distance, isolation, and sparse resources they encounter. The boundaries between home and work blur because clients are also neighbors and friends of immediate family members. Nurses are highly regarded by the community and viewed as experts on health and illness. Residents may ask health-related questions and request recommendations whenever they see the nurse. Nurses in rural areas may also be expected to, in general, know something about everything, and this can be a demanding expectation. Some of the challenges are professional isolation, limited opportunities for continuing education, lack of other health personnel or professionals with whom the nurse can interact, heavy workloads, the need to function well in several clinical areas, lack of anonymity, and for some, a restricted social life."

Similarly, a direct correlation exists between poverty and poor health outcomes. Poor teens are nearly three times more likely to drop out of school as their nonpoor counterparts. When programs that assist the mother to complete her education are instituted, chances are increased for a better future, which improves health care over the long term across the life span.

        "Explanation": "Teens are often ignorant concerning sexuality and pregnancy and often very embarrassed to discuss such topics. Further, they often believe myths such as they cannot get pregnant the first time they have sex. The earlier their sexual debut, the less likely a birth control method will be used, because younger teens have less knowledge. Teens are more likely to be sexually active if their friends are sexually active. Teens who are knowledgeable and want to be responsible often find it difficult to access birth control. Confidential reproductive health care services may be available for teens, but problems are still associated with transportation, school absences, and costs of care.

        "Question": "A nurse is trying to decrease the risk for depression among older adults. Which of the following interventions should the nurse implement?",
        "Choice 1": "Encourage moving to a nursing home where others of the same age reside.",
        "Choice 2": "Monitor for signs and symptoms of depression.",
        "Choice 3": "Organize an exercise and health promotion program at the local senior citizen center.",
        "Choice 4": "Teach older clients to focus on their strengths rather than their weaknesses.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The depression rate among older adults is half that of younger people, but the presence of a physical or chronic illness increases rates of depression. Depression rates for older adults in nursing homes range from 15% to 25%; thus, encouraging older adults to move to nursing homes would certainly not decrease their risk for depression. Healthy aging activities such as physical activity and establishing social networks improve the mental health of older adults. Older adults underuse the mental health system and are more likely to be seen in primary care or to be recipients of care in institutions. The nurse can reach them by organizing health promotion programs through senior centers or other community-based settings. Telling clients to focus on strengths instead of weaknesses is not helpful—this advice can sound flippant and patronizing if (1) the weaknesses are profound and (2) tools are not given to assist in coping. Monitoring for signs of depression is not an effective approach because this—like most programs currently available for adults, families, and caregivers with health problems—focuses on identifying rather than preventing problems."

        "Choice 1": "Asking caregivers how they are doing and suggesting coping strategies",
        "Choice 2": "Encouraging caregivers to periodically leave the house for a couple of hours",

        "Choice 4": "Referring some activities to neighbors and friends",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Secondary prevention activities involve screening activities that allow for early recognition of problems so that prompt interventions can limit disability. By asking caregivers how they are coping (thus screening), the nurse identifies problems early so that interventions can be employed to limit the extent of stress, thus paving the way for improvement. The other options are either primary or tertiary activities depending on whether the intervention takes place before or after caregiving stress has developed. Also, encouraging caregivers to periodically leave the house for a couple of hours could result in negative outcomes for the person needing care (unless a competent substitute is filling in for the primary caregiver)."

        "Explanation": "Accessibility refers to the ability of clients to obtain needed health care services.\r\nAlthough all of these options lead to opportunities for improvement in health, either directly or indirectly, only applying for a grant for a mobile clinic can potentially improve accessibility to a health care clinic. Neighborhood clinics, mobile vans, and home visits can bring health care to people otherwise unable to access care.

        "Explanation": "Self-awareness is a key component of providing authentic, genuine client-centered care. To clarify their own values and perspectives about poverty, nurses should ask themselves questions about poverty and persons living in poverty. These questions should cause the nurse to reflect on how his or her ideas of poverty have been developed.

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "3, 4",
        "Explanation": "Most young women suspect pregnancy as soon as a period is late. These young women may still delay seeking care, because they falsely hope that the pregnancy will just go away. A teen also may delay seeking care because she wants to keep the pregnancy a secret from her parents, who may pressure her to terminate the pregnancy, or because she does not want to have a gynecological examination. Barriers to care early in the pregnancy also include the real or perceived costs of care, lack of transportation, dislike or fear of the needed exams, and apprehension about the attitude of care providers toward her.

Lice are a common problem among school children, and the presence of lice does not indicate neglect.

Unfortunately, abuse tends to escalate in frequency and severity over time, and the man’s remorse tends to lessen. A nurse encountering severe abuse needs to consider the safety of the woman and her children as the priority. The woman will need an order of protection and help in getting to a safe place.

These programs are most effective if they are court-mandated and if the man’s underlying values about women are addressed, as well as his violence. Violence is defined as those nonaccidental acts that result in physical or psychological injury.

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "An individual who tests positive has been exposed and may be infected, but if that person shows no clinical signs, the person is not diseased. Infection refers to the entry, development, and multiplication of the infectious agent in the susceptible host. Disease is one of the possible outcomes of infection. People with latent TB have no symptoms, are not infectious, and can continue on with life. They may develop active TB. A nurse who interacts with clients may receive INH for a year as a precaution."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "It may take up to 6 months after exposure to the HIV virus before an HIV antibody test can test positive, although most infected people will test positive within 3 months. A negative test, therefore, is not a reliable indicator of infection status if exposure is very recent. The incubation period or the time interval between invasion by an infectious agent and the first appearance of signs and symptoms of the disease may be between 10 and 15 years for AIDS."

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Syndromic surveillance systems use existing health data in real time to provide immediate analysis and feedback to those charged with investigation and follow-up of potential outbreaks. These systems incorporate factors such as the previously mentioned temporal and geographic clustering and unusual age distributions with groups of disease symptoms or syndromes (e.g., flaccid paralysis, respiratory signs, skin rashes, gastrointestinal symptoms) with the goal of detecting early signs of diseases that could result from a bioterrorism-related attack. Syndromic surveillance systems may include tracking emergency department visits sorted by syndrome symptoms as well as other indicators of illness including school absenteeism and sales of selected over-the-counter medications.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Most of the emergence factors are consequences of activities and behavior of the human hosts and of environmental changes such as deforestation, urbanization, and industrialization. For example, the rise in households with two working parents has increased the number of children in  daycare, and with this shift has come an increase in diarrheal diseases such as shigellosis.

        "Explanation": "The goal of prevention and control programs is to reduce the prevalence of a disease to a level at which it no longer poses a major public health problem. In some cases, diseases may even be eliminated or eradicated. The goal of elimination is to remove a disease from a large geographical area (e.g., a country or region of the world), such as has been done with polio in the Americas.

If given after exposure (i.e., the client may be infected but disease has not developed), they are considered secondary prevention (similar to the textbook examples of immunoglobulin and rabies immunizations given after exposure). Immunoglobulin would be given if the client had not been previously immunized; however, this again is after exposure, so it is secondary prevention.

        "Explanation": "Escherichia coli O157:H7 can produce a strong cytotoxin that can cause a potentially fatal hemorrhagic colitis. Hamburger is often involved in outbreaks, since the grinding process exposes pathogens on the surface of the whole meat to the interior of the ground meat, effectively mixing the once-exterior bacteria thoroughly throughout the hamburger so that searing the surface no longer suffices to kill all bacteria. Also, hamburger is often made of meat ground from several sources. The best protection against foodborne pathogens is to thoroughly cook food before eating it. Salmonella is also transmitted by undercooked foods such as eggs, poultry, dairy products, and seafood. Consequently, students eating very rare hamburger and undercooked eggs are at high risk."

        "Explanation": "The client needs to understand that the test cannot identify infections that may have been acquired within the previous 3 months before the test.

        "Explanation": "AIDS is defined as a disabling or life-threatening illness caused by HIV; it is diagnosed in a person with a CD4 T-lymphocyte count of less than 200/ml with or without documented HIV infection. The HIV antibody test (usually the EIA) is the most commonly used screening test for determining whether the antibody to HIV is present but does not confirm AIDS. Positive results with the EIA are tested further with the Western blot test. However, false-negative results are frequent between 6 weeks and 3 months following exposure."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "HIV can be transmitted through exposure to blood, semen, vaginal secretions, and breast milk and by sharing needles, syringes, and other equipment used to prepare injectable drugs. It can also be spread by perinatal transmission from mother to child through delivery or breastfeeding and by transfusions of contaminated blood. HIV is not transmitted through casual contact such as touching or hugging someone who has HIV infection.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "An advantage of anonymous testing may be that it increases the number of people who are willing to be tested, because many of those at risk are engaged in illegal activities. The anonymity eliminates their concern about the possibility of arrest or discrimination."

        "Explanation": "Pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, is a new HIV prevention method for people who do not have the infection but would like to reduce their risk of becoming infected. PrEP requires taking a pill to prevent the HIV virus from getting into the body. It has been shown to be effective for people at very high risk for HIV infection through sex; the results about its effectiveness with injection drug users are not yet available. This prevention method requires strict adherence to taking the medication and having regular HIV testing; it is also used in combination with other HIV prevention methods rather than in isolation (CDC: PrEP, 2012b)."

Chlamydia does have serious long-term outcomes for the client, but so do syphilis and other STDs. However, unlike syphilis, which in its later stages is rare in the United States, chlamydia is the most common reportable infectious disease in the United States and hence is a major focus of public health."

        "Choice 1": "“Cervical cancer treatments may decrease immunity, so that it is easier to acquire STDs.”",
        "Choice 2": "“Cervical cancer usually is caused by HPV, and often the presence of one STD is accompanied by other STDs.”",
        "Choice 3": "“The presence of an STD in women with cervical cancer may lead to congenital defects in offspring.”",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The link between HPV infection and cervical cancer has been established and is associated with specific types of the virus. In 80% to 90% of cases of cervical cancer, evidence of HPV has been found in the tumor. Additionally, HSV-2 infection is linked with the development of cervical cancer. Because the presence of an STD increases the risk for the presence of other STDs, it is essential to screen for this information."

        "Choice 1": "Everyone would assume the person infected with hepatitis B is a drug user.",
        "Choice 2": "Having HBV would mean no further employment in health care.",

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Both HBV and HIV are blood-borne pathogens. Health care workers may be exposed to either from needle stick injuries and mucous membrane splashes. However, HBV remains alive outside the body for a longer time than does HIV and thus has greater infectivity. The virus can survive for at least 1 week dried at room temperature on environmental surfaces, and therefore infection control measures are crucial in preventing transmission. There is no treatment for hepatitis B, and although some persons never have symptoms and others fight off the disease, many suffer from chronic hepatitis B, a very serious illness. Others may become chronic carriers of the disease."

        "Choice 1": "“One injection protects your son, while the other encourages his body to build up immunity.”",
        "Choice 2": "“One shot keeps your son from getting sick, while the other is a typical vaccine to prevent you from accidentally infecting him.”",

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Because infected persons may not have any symptoms, all pregnant women should be tested for HBsAg.

        "Choice 2": "“This therapy is recommended to make sure that you receive the treatment you need and the infection doesn't become resistant to the drugs.”",

        "Explanation": "It is important to be respectful to clients and to consider their perspective and psychological health while also responding truthfully. Directly observed therapy (DOT) programs for TB medication involve the nurse observing and documenting individual clients taking their TB drugs. When clients prematurely stop taking TB medications, there is a risk that the TB will become resistant to the medications. This can affect an entire community of people who are susceptible to this airborne disease. DOT ensures that TB-infected clients receive adequate medication. Thus, DOT programs are aimed at the population level to prevent antibiotic resistance in the community and to ensure effective treatment at the individual level. Many health departments have DOT home health programs to ensure adequate treatment."

        "Explanation": "Because of impaired immunity, children with HIV infection are more likely to get childhood diseases and suffer serious consequences of the diseases. Therefore, DPT, IPV, and MMR vaccines should be given at regularly scheduled times for children infected with HIV. Other immunizations may also be recommended after medical evaluation.

        "Choice 1": "The child develops allergies with sneezing.",
        "Choice 2": "The child persists in biting behavior or is unable to control body secretions.",
        "Choice 3": "The nurse is not comfortable with being responsible for the child.",
        "Choice 4": "There is an outbreak of chickenpox in the school.",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "2, 4",
        "Explanation": "Not attending school may be advisable if cases of childhood infections, such as chickenpox or measles, occur in the school, because the immunosuppressed child is at greater risk for suffering complications. Alternative arrangements, such as homebound instruction, might be instituted if a child is unable to control body secretions or displays biting behavior. HIV-positive children are encouraged to obtain routine immunizations, because their immune systems are compromised and they are more susceptible to such infections. To date, no cases of HIV infections being transmitted in a school setting have occurred in the United States. Strong disapproval by parents of well children is an opportunity to teach these persons how HIV is transmitted."

I don’t have an STD!” Which of the following statements would be most appropriate for the nurse to say to them? (Select all that apply.)",
        "Choice 1": "“Actually, you’re very fortunate to have been tested so you and your partner can begin treatment before more serious damage is done.”",
        "Choice 2": "“Some STDs may not have any symptoms, so you need to be tested for other conditions and treated if necessary.”",
        "Choice 3": "“Sometimes the test is inaccurate, so before getting too upset, you should ask to be tested again.”",
        "Choice 4": "“You may be able to get treatment from your pharmacist so you won’t have to be embarrassed like this again.”",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 2, 3",
        "Explanation": "Often cases of gonorrhea and chlamydia are asymptomatic, so treatment may not be sought and these infections are spread to others through sexual activity. Similarly, during latency, syphilis has no symptoms. It should be noted, however, that STD test results can sometimes be incorrect and the coexistence of other medical conditions may cause a false-positive test result. Having a partner retested, if the results were negative, would also suggest retesting the first person."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "2, 3",
        "Explanation": "The nurse should ask about sexual contacts and ask who (if anyone) lives with the client because the named individuals will need to have immune globulin administered to hopefully prevent the spread of hepatitis A and a community epidemic. The nurse should also ask about the client’s place of employment because certain settings warrant special considerations. For example, in restaurants, hospitals, daycare centers, or other institutions, the lack of careful hand-washing by an infected worker can result in contamination of many others."

        "Explanation": "In the United States, the local-state-federal partnership includes federal agencies, the state and territorial public health agencies, and the local public health agencies.

This was followed by participation in group prayer (38%), deep breathing exercises (30%), and meditation (30%). Participants reported that prayer was used to give thanks for support of others and for themselves, whereas others reported that prayer allowed them to share their burden with a higher power. A few participants equated prayer with meditation, which evoked a calming state. Some participants did not equate prayer with being religious or with church attendance.

In case of an emergency event, state and local health departments in the affected area will be expected to collect data and accurately report the situation, to respond appropriately to any type of emergency, and to ensure the safety of the residents of the immediate area, while protecting those just outside the danger zone. This goal—to enable public health agencies to anticipate, prepare for, recognize, and respond to terrorist threats or natural disasters—has required an unprecedented level of interstate and federal-local planning and cooperation among these agencies."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The responsibilities and functions of other health professions in home care are dictated by Medicare regulations, professional organizations, and state licensing boards. Many of these services can be provided on a consulting basis. The plan of care should be implemented and reinforced by all involved disciplines. Therefore, interdisciplinary collaboration is required in the home health setting. Such collaboration does not conflict with the concept of providing direct care services. Direct care refers to the actual physical aspects of nursing care—anything requiring physical contact and face-to-face interactions. In home care, direct care activities include performing a physical assessment on the client, changing a dressing on a wound, giving medication by injection, inserting an indwelling catheter, or providing intravenous therapy. Direct care also involves teaching clients and family caregivers how to perform a certain procedure or task."

        "Choice 1": "“Every time I see a client, it costs $80.”",
        "Choice 2": "“Health care costs are killing our economy.”",
        "Choice 3": "“I can’t believe how much clients are charged for things.”",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Nurses in many settings are not directly exposed to the financial aspects of health care, although as citizens they should be aware of the overall effects of high health care costs. In home health, nurses must be cost-conscious so that they can accurately explain to clients what Medicare will or will not cover and discuss other financial concerns. In addition, home care nurses must be knowledgeable about which medical supplies are covered."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "To receive home health services, clients must be homebound. Although home health care is less expensive than hospitalization, it remains much more costly than a traditional visit to a clinic; therefore, those who are not homebound would be expected to receive care at a clinic."

        "Choice 1": "Clients find it difficult to learn in the midst of the stress of the acute care setting and often don’t remember what the hospital nurse taught.",
        "Choice 2": "Hearing something from a different person, using different words and examples, can help ensure that learning is retained.",
        "Choice 3": "Home health nurses often don’t know what hospital-based nurses have already taught.",
        "Choice 4": "Learning depends on receiving information more than once.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Although all of the responses are potentially true, the bottom line is that clients may find it difficult to learn while they are hospitalized. Consequently, home care nurses should communicate clearly with discharge planners about the therapeutic plan and medication regimens, as well as what clients have been taught about self-care and symptoms that should be reported to the physician. The nurse should share this same information again, unless the client clearly demonstrates having the knowledge and skills being reviewed."

        "Choice 4": "Washing all surfaces with disinfectant",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Universal precautions mean that all blood and body fluids are treated as potentially infectious, especially because many infections are subclinical. The nurse would use extreme care to prevent injuries when handling needles, scalpels, and razors and discard needles and syringes in puncture-resistant containers; use protective coverings if contact with blood and body fluids is expected; put materials contaminated with body fluids in double polyethylene garbage bags; and tell the family to be sure to use detergent in warm water to clean kitchen counters, dishes, and laundry and household disinfectant when cleaning the bathrooms. However, the single most important practice in preventing infections is careful hand washing before and after client care, touching food, or using the bathroom."

        "Explanation": "Both The Joint Commission (TJC) and the Community Health Accreditation Program (CHAP) of the National League for Nursing (NLN) look at the organizational structure through which care is delivered, the process of care through home visits, and the outcomes of client care, focusing on improved health status. Performance improvement must be ongoing in the agency. It is assumed the credentials of each employee were confirmed before employment."

        "Choice 1": "“All your father’s medical bills will be paid by whichever program is appropriate.”",
        "Choice 2": "“Choose any physician and just show them your Medicare or Medicaid card.”",
        "Choice 3": "“Your father must be homebound to qualify for Medicare assistance but less so for Medicaid.”",
        "Choice 4": "“Medicare is a federally funded program, but Medicaid is administered by your state.”",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "3, 4",
        "Explanation": "Many physicians will not accept a client on Medicare or Medicaid because of the low reimbursement rates. A deduction from Social Security is made for Medicare premiums, and clients are still responsible for deductibles and copays, so it is misleading to tell the family that all their father’s medical bills will be paid. Medicare, for those age 65 and over or disabled, is a federal insurance program administered by the Social Security Administration, whereas Medicaid, based on a client’s lack of financial resources, is a federal and state assistance program administered by the state. Medicare will only pay for home health care by skilled professionals while the client is homebound, whereas Medicaid does not necessarily require homebound status and may reimburse for home health aides and other nonskilled supportive services."

The nurse cannot convince children to accept other children as peers, although certainly efforts should be made. HIPAA would not allow individual examples of health problems to be shared, other than providing group statistics."

        "Choice 1": "There is a shortage of baccalaureate-prepared nurses with national school health nurse certification.",
        "Choice 2": "Most nurses prefer to be employed in hospitals giving direct care.",
        "Choice 3": "Most school districts are unable to afford a nurse in every school.",
        "Choice 4": "School districts and taxpayers see no need for nurses in schools.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "In Healthy People 2020, objective ECBP-5 states that there should be one nurse for every 750 children in each school (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010). Most schools have not achieved this objective. In 2006, approximately 40% of the nation’s schools met that standard. The new objective is that 44.7% of the country’s elementary, middle, junior high, and senior high schools have this many nurses by 2020 (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010). Having fewer nurses in the schools means that the nurses are expected to perform many different functions. It is therefore possible that they are unable to provide the amount of comprehensive care that the students need (Croghan, 2009)."

        "Explanation": "School health nurses were originally involved in this capacity in 1987 after the CDC began funding schools for HIV-prevention education programs. This program was so successful that it was expanded to include programs to teach children prevention of other chronic illnesses caused in part by risk factors such as poor diet, lack of exercise, and smoking.

A confidential file should be made about the incident; however, the nurse should let the government authorities, usually the state or county child protection department, look into the suspected case.

The principal asked the nurse who the children were so that the involved teachers could both support the injured child and guard other children from the violent child. Which of the following would be the best response by the nurse?",

The nurse must follow the HIPAA privacy rules while also ensuring the safety of children at school. When a rumor is involved, it is always wise to check its accuracy. If a child was indeed hurt, the nurse needs to make sure both children involved receive (or have already received) appropriate care. The question about having a school-wide program may be appropriate, but this behavior was apparently purposeful, not accidental."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "2, 4",
        "Explanation": "The U.S. government began funding school-based health centers essentially because many school children may not receive health care services otherwise. These are family-centered, community-based clinics run within the schools. Certainly, avoiding pregnancy and drug addiction are among the goals of school-based health centers, but these are not reasons the government began funding them."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 4",
        "Explanation": "There are many problems with children not being immunized or having incomplete vaccination records, especially in families who have moved many times or who may not have a regular physician. The parents may have no idea whether the child has received the required shots. Families may also be without health care insurance to pay for the immunizations, or they may have insurance that does not pay for preventive care. In these cases, they may lack the resources to pay for the immunizations themselves. Therefore, the nurse’s role is to be sure parents are aware of the problem, to help them obtain the records if they have been misplaced, and to suggest ways to obtain the injections without charge, even if there is no obvious evidence that lack of funds is the problem. Telling the teacher or principal won’t resolve the problem and it is illegal, immoral, and unprofessional to enter false information in a student’s record."

Basic necessary equipment includes full oxygen tanks with oxygen masks of different kinds, splints, cervical spine collars, sterile dressings, and an epinephrine autoinjector kit in case a child goes into anaphylactic shock after exposure to an allergen.

        "Explanation": "Various control strategies are used to eliminate or reduce exposure and hence risk. Engineering controls can reduce worker exposure by modifying the exposure source. Administrative controls reduce exposure through job rotation, workplace monitoring, and employee training and education. Personal protective control is the last resort and requires the worker to actively engage in strategies for protection such as use of gloves, masks, and gowns to prevent blood/body fluid exposure. External controls—the way equipment is built or manufacturing processes are established—are controllable and much more effective than asking a great many individuals to engage in behaviors that they may not want to do (such as using personal protective equipment). Humans are much less programmable than external controls."

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Workers’ compensation acts are important state laws that govern financial compensation of employees who suffer work-related health problems. Each state sets rules for the reimbursement of employees with occupational health problems for medical expenses and lost work time associated with the illness or injury. Workers’ compensation claims and the experience-based insurance premiums paid by industry have been important motivators for increasing the health and safety of the workplace."

        "Explanation": "The goals of a disaster plan are to prevent or minimize injuries and deaths of workers and residents, minimize property damage, provide effective triage, and facilitate necessary business activities. A disaster plan requires the cooperation of company and community. The nurse is often a key person on the disaster planning team. The potential for disaster must be identified; this is best achieved by completing an exhaustive chemical and hazard inventory of the workplace. The MSDSs and plant blueprints are critical for correctly identifying substances and work areas that may be hazardous. Worksite surveys are the first step to completing this inventory."

It involves the prevention of adverse health effects from occupational and environmental hazards. It provides for and delivers occupational and environmental health and safety services to workers, worker populations, and community groups. It is an autonomous specialty, and nurses make independent nursing judgments in providing health care. All nurses should engage in health promotion and disease prevention, and many specialties provide care in the community. Several specialties (such as advanced practice nurses) are required to be nationally certified to be employed."

        "Choice 3": "Effects of chemicals can be cumulative.",
        "Choice 4": "Interactions of chemicals are typically unknown.",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "3, 4",
        "Explanation": "Of the approximately 2 million known chemicals in existence, less than 0.1% have been adequately studied for their effects on humans. Most chemicals have not been studied epidemiologically to determine the effects of exposure on humans. A variety of chemicals are found in the body tissues of the general population. Daily, low-level doses of chemicals may be below the exposure standards but may still carry a potentially chronic and perhaps cumulative assault on workers’ health. Predicting human responses to such exposures is further complicated because several chemicals are often combined to create a new chemical agent. Human effects may be associated with the interaction of these agents rather than with a single chemical. Another concern about occupational exposure to chemicals is reproductive health effects."

OSHA employees have distributed citations to companies that do not meet minimal occupational health and safety standards. Criminal charges have been filed against business owners when preventable work-related deaths have occurred.

        "Answer": "2, 3",
        "Explanation": "All business organizations are classified within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) with a numerical code. This code, usually a digit to digit number, indicates a company’s product and, therefore, the possible types of occupational health hazards that may be associated with the processes and materials used by its employees. NAICS codes are used to collect and report data on businesses. For example, illness and injury rates of one company are compared with the rates of other companies of similar size with the same NAICS code to determine whether the company is having an excess of illness or injury. By knowing the NAICS code of a company, a health care professional can access reference books that describe the usual processes, materials, and by-products of that kind of company."

Before any intervention can be made, the health care professionals must understand the family’s cultural, psychological, social, communal, and environmental contexts, because these contexts affect the way issues are formulated and decisions are made.

        "Explanation": "One of the rules in deontological decision making is to determine whether the proposed actions can be generalized so that all persons in similar situations are treated similarly. In the same way, principlism suggests the nurse examine the context and make the decision that can be morally justified within that context."

You have to take care of me!” Which of the following premises would ethically justify such a demand for immediate attention?",
        "Choice 1": "All hospitals receive federal money and all capable employed adults pay taxes, so all adults have a right to what their tax money has purchased.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The ethical theory of egalitarianism suggests that everyone is entitled to equal rights, equal treatment, and an equal share of the goods of society—and that the government’s role is to ensure this happens, at least on a basic level.

        "Choice 2": "“Political action is the way you try to fulfill your ethical responsibilities to clients.”",

        "Question": "Three nurses disagree over the appropriate treatment for a woman who is an excellent candidate for hospice care. The first nurse believes that deciding on care rather than cure is the woman’s decision and no one else can decide for her. The second nurse says that it is the responsibility of the health care team to do good for the woman, and if the physician thinks there is still a possibility of cure, then the nurses should do everything they can to implement the treatment plan. The third nurse states that it isn’t fair for the family members to expend all their resources on the woman, who is probably going to die anyway. Which of the following conclusions can be drawn from this dispute? (Select all that apply.)",

Which of the following is the most likely explanation?",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Cultural skill is the effective integration of cultural knowledge and awareness to meet client needs—in this case, the client’s need to not be offended by having the bottom of the nurse’s foot or shoe in view of the client’s face. The nurse using cultural skill makes sure nonverbal communication techniques take into consideration the client’s use of body language and space. Cultural accommodation involves negotiation with clients to include aspects of their folk practices with the traditional health care system to implement essential treatment plans. Cultural imposition is the process of imposing one’s values on others. Cultural repatterning is working with clients to make changes in their health practices if cultural behaviors are harmful or decrease their well-being."

        "Question": "At a local hospital, postpartum care policy requires that nurses observe the mother during infant care to assess the mother’s ability to care for the new baby and to promote bonding. A new mother expresses concern that in her country, all infant care is provided by other family members so that the mother can rest and recover. Which of the following actions would be taken by a culturally competent nurse?",
        "Choice 1": "Allow family members to provide the newborn’s care and assess the mother’s knowledge of child care through discussion.",
        "Choice 2": "Reinforce the importance of bonding and that all good mothers gladly assume these responsibilities.",
        "Choice 3": "Explain that the process of postpartum recovery does not require this much rest and require that she provide infant care.",
        "Choice 4": "State that she must abide by hospital policy because documentation of the mother’s ability to give the infant care is required for discharge.",

The nurse’s next client is an African-American mother of newborn twins who worked until the children were born. The nurse knows the woman is eligible to maintain her insurance after her employment was lost and does not discuss insurance options at all. Which of the following errors is being made by the nurse?",

        "Explanation": "The nurse may have assumed that the African-American mother knew the available resources and could negotiate for assistance on her own and that the immigrant Russian woman had no experience negotiating government programs and thus needed the nurse to advocate for her and inform her of the programs available to her. The nurse, not knowing the health-seeking behaviors of either client, stereotyped both women and intentionally used her informational power to help one client while denying assistance to the other client."

Through physical gestures, the woman indicates that the pain is originating in either the pelvic or genital region. Which of the following interpreters would be the most appropriate in this situation?",
        "Choice 1": "A Bosnian male who is certified as a medical interpreter",
        "Choice 2": "A female from the client’s community",
        "Choice 3": "A female who does not know the client",
        "Choice 4": "The client’s 20-year-old daughter",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Although having experience in medical interpretation is important, in many cultures it is inappropriate to have a male interpreter for females. This client has specifically requested a female provider; therefore, one might anticipate that the client will not be as forthcoming with a male interpreter. Regardless of certification and ability, the interpreter cannot interpret information the client may withhold because she feels it inappropriate to discuss private matters in front of a male. This client may also feel it inappropriate to have private matters interpreted by her daughter (especially if they are of a sexual nature or if they involve infidelity). Additionally, to avoid a breach of confidentiality, the nurse should avoid using an interpreter from the same community as the client."

        "Explanation": "In a brief cultural assessment, nurses ask clients about their ethnic background, religious preference, family patterns, cultural values, language, education, politics and health practices. Nurses want to also ask about the client’s perception of the health issue and what caused it and how it should be treated as well as the results they expect from the care they get.

State power concerning health care is called police power. This power allows states to act to protect the health, safety, and welfare of their citizens. The state must show that it has a compelling interest in taking actions, especially actions that might infringe on individual rights. The state can isolate an individual to prevent an epidemic, even though this infringes on individual rights.

Students are expected to meet the same standard of care as that met by any licensed nurse practicing under the same or similar circumstances. Although it is true that students cannot practice outside the scope of practice determined by the nurse practice act, they also cannot perform the tasks and responsibilities of the licensed practitioner within the scope of practice until they have received adequate knowledge; therefore, the scope of practice for the student is determined by the instructor, based on the student’s level of education."

        "Explanation": "Once a bill is passed and becomes law, it is too late to influence congressional members to change their vote; however, it is not too late to influence the outcome of the vote because the nurse can influence how the law is regulated. An agency typically writes the regulations that control how the law is implemented in more specific detail. Often this process can be just as important as lobbying against a bill because it shapes the final implementation of the law."

All of the factors listed affect health care access and therefore affect health care rationing (either directly or indirectly). The primary determinant, however, is the ability to pay for services.

        "Choice 1": "A huge amount of paperwork is required when Medicaid clients go to a physician’s office.",
        "Choice 2": "Government regulations require Medicaid clients to use emergency departments when their primary health care provider is unavailable.",

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "People on Medicaid frequently have no primary care provider and may not be able to pay for their care. Although physicians can choose clients based on their ability to pay, emergency departments are required by law to evaluate every client regardless of ability to pay. Emergency department copayments are modest and are frequently waived if the client is unable to pay. Thus, low out-of-pocket costs provide incentives for Medicaid clients and the uninsured to use emergency departments for primary care services."

Care for clients continues to move out of the hospital setting and into the community. Chronic disease management will be a challenge for health care providers; however, new guidelines should ease the care provided for these diseases and wouldn’t be seen as a challenge. The use of technology will continue to increase, but the need for health care workers will not be decreasing. New health care careers will emerge because of the changes in technology."

        "Explanation": "As a result of rising health costs, Congress passed a law in 1983 that mandated an end to cost-plus reimbursement and instituted a prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services to shift the cost incentives away from the providing of more care and toward more efficient services. The basis for prospective reimbursement is the 468 diagnosis-related groups (DRGs)."

Reimbursement, whether prospective or retrospective, is based on the same criteria, but managed care integrates the financing and the delivery of health care. The concept of managed care is that costly care could be reduced if consumers had access to education and health promotion."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 3",
        "Explanation": "Businesses can pay for disease prevention and health promotion services for employees (and sometimes their families) in the form of immunizations, health screenings, and counseling. The business can then deduct these costs as a business expense, which reduces the amount the business owes the government in taxes on their profits. Similarly, when businesses subsidize health insurance for their employees—and families—this is also a business expense, which decreases the amount the business would otherwise pay in taxes. Thus, the government indirectly provides the money, but the business, a part of the private sector, decides how it is used."

Results have included shorter hospital stays and substitution of one set of personnel (such as nurse practitioners) for another set (physicians).

        "Choice 2": "The proportion of cases of gonorrhea to chlamydia was 300:500.",
        "Choice 3": "The proportion of cases of gonorrhea to all STIs was 50%.",
        "Choice 4": "The proportion of STIs to the total population was 100:1000.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "A proportion is a ratio in which the denominator includes the numerator.\r\nIf the proportion is small, we can express the number per 1000. The answer of 300:1300 adds the total of the numerator to the denominator, which is unnecessary because the gonorrhea cases were already included in the denominator. In the answer of 300:500, the ratio comparing gonorrhea to chlamydia does not meet the epidemiological definition of proportion (i.e., the denominator must contain the numerator). Although proportions may be expressed as percentages, in the answer of 50% the percentage reflects the number of gonorrhea cases to all STIs, which doesn’t summarize the total STI problem. The answer of 100:1000 correctly summarizes that 1000 of 10,000 (or 100:1000) young women had the problem."

Over the next few years, the nursing staff developed and implemented educational programs about the risk factors for diabetes mellitus Type 2 and proper nutrition. Which of the following would be most useful for the nurses to use to determine if they are having any impact?",
        "Choice 1": "The epidemic of diabetes in the high school is gradually ending.",
        "Choice 2": "The incidence of diabetes is slowly decreasing during screening events.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Incidence rates and incidence proportions are the measure of choice to study etiology because incidence is affected only by factors related to the risk of developing disease and not to survival or cure. Prevalence is a fairly stable number over time, but incidence reacts more quickly to changes in risk factors or intervention programs. If the educational programs are having the desired impact, the incidence of diabetes being diagnosed will decrease in future screenings."

Incidence refers to new cases, whereas prevalence means all cases. We don’t know whether the finding represents the first time a woman was told she had an STI or whether she had previously been diagnosed with the problem. Therefore, we can’t say whether these are new cases (incidence), but the results do represent all cases (prevalence). Risk is the probability of developing an STI, but no risk factors are discussed."

        "Choice 4": "Students who are sexually active but never “go all the way”",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "2, 3, 4",
        "Explanation": "Those already diagnosed with the problem are not at risk, because they already have the condition and are no longer at risk for developing it."

        "Exam Name": "Foundation of Nursing",

        "Question": "A nurse is planning to host a health screening at a large urban mall. Which of the following variables will help the nurse determine which screenings should be included? (Select all that apply.)",
        "Choice 1": "Adequate space for persons to lie down after testing until side effects are reduced",
        "Choice 2": "Health problems for which the specific population is at risk",
        "Choice 3": "Whether adequate privacy can be obtained for the invasive or embarrassing procedures",
        "Choice 4": "Whether health care providers are available to follow up on any positive screening results",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "2, 4",
        "Explanation": "The screening tests should be reliable, valid, fast, and inexpensive. They should have few side effects, be minimally invasive, and be capable of detecting enough new cases to warrant the effort and expense. Results should be known immediately. No tests should be used that have negative side effects, are invasive, or cause embarrassment. Ethically, nurses should not screen for any problem unless they can refer those with positive results to a source for follow-up testing and treatment."

        "Exam Name": "Foundation of Nursing",
        "Test Number": "2771",
        "Question": "A nurse believes a new mouth care procedure (MCP) is causing more mouth problems than it is helping to avoid. Which of the following must be present for the nurse to go to administration with confidence that the new mouth care procedure (MCP) is causing problems? (Select all that apply.)",
        "Choice 1": "A plausible explanation of how the new MCP could cause harm",
        "Choice 2": "A strong feeling that the MCP is the cause",
        "Choice 3": "Consistently seeing mouth inflammation in many of the patients who have received the MCP",
        "Choice 4": "Documentation from patient records that mouth inflammation in clients did not occur until after the new procedure was implemented",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 3, 4",
        "Explanation": "Strength of association is suggested by the fact that patients who did not receive the MCP and patients seen on the floor before the new MCP did not have problems, whereas patients who received the new MCP are having problems. Seeing the problems in many of the patients suggests a consistency. The fact that those who had the procedure more often have worse problems suggests a dose-response relationship. A plausible explanation of how the new procedure could cause harm enhances the biological risk. Feelings alone are not convincing. A study should be set up to confirm or dispute the nurse’s hypothesis. Although one would hope that previous testing would have been done before the product was released to market, the product could be safe for healthy persons but a risky process for those with compromised immunity or those who are under stress."
