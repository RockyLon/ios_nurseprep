        "Choice 1": "Physicians’ need for handmaidens",
        "Choice 2": "Societal need for healthcare outside the home",
        "Choice 3": "Military demand for nurses in the field",
        "Choice 4": "Germ theory influence on sanitation",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Throughout the centuries, stability of the government has been related to the success of the military to protect or extend its domain. As the survival and well-being of soldiers is critical, nurses provided healthcare to the sick and injured at the battle site. The physician's handmaiden was/is a nursing stereotype rather than an influence on nursing. Although there has been need for healthcare outside the home throughout history, this has more influence on the development of hospitals than on nursing; this need provided one more setting for nursing work. Germ theory and sanitation helped to improve healthcare but did not shape nursing."

        "Choice 4": "Teaching a diabetic patient about his diet",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Administering immunization for HPV is an example of illness prevention. Although cancer is a disease, it is assumed that a person joining a support group would already have the disease; therefore, this is not disease prevention but treatment. Illness-prevention activities focus on avoiding a specific disease. A food diary is a health-promotion activity. Teaching a diabetic patient about diet is a treatment for diabetes; the patient already has diabetes, so it cannot prevent diabetes."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Improved sanitation (a clean environment) greatly and immediately reduced the rate of infection and mortality in hospitals. The other responses are all activities of Florence Nightingale that improved healthcare or nursing, but the impact is long range, not immediate."

        "Question": "All of the following are aspects of the full-spectrum nursing role. Which one is essential for the nurse to do in order to successfully carry out all the others?",
        "Choice 1": "Thinking and reasoning about the client’s care",
        "Choice 2": "Providing hands-on client care",
        "Choice 3": "Carrying out physician orders",
        "Choice 4": "Delegating to assistive personnel",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "A substantial portion of the nursing role involves using clinical judgment, critical thinking, and problem solving, which directly affect the care the client will actually receive. Providing hands-on care is important; however, clinical judgment, critical thinking, and problem solving are essential to do it successfully. Carrying out physician orders is a small part of a nurse’s role; it, too, requires nursing assessment, planning, intervention, and evaluation. Many simple nursing tasks are being delegated to nursing assistive personnel; delegation requires careful analysis of patient status and the appropriateness of support personnel to deliver care. Another way to analyze this question is that none of the options of providing hands-on care, carrying out physician orders, and delegating to assistive personnel is required for the nurse to think and reason about a client’s care; so the answer must be 1."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Movement through the stages is not constant. Benner’s model is based on integration of knowledge, technical skill, and intuition in the development of clinical wisdom. The model does not mention experience in many areas. The model does not mention years of experience."

        "Choice 1": "There are too many different and conflicting images of nurses.",

        "Choice 4": "There are different education pathways and levels of practice.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The conflicting images of nursing make it more important to develop a definition; they may also make it more difficult, but not to the extent that constant change does. Healthcare is constantly changing and with it come changes in where, how, and what nursing care is delivered. Constant changes make it difficult to develop a definition. Although different nursing organizations have different definitions, they are similar in most ways. The different education pathways affect entry into practice, not the definition of nursing."

        "Choice 3": "Nurses have achieved some independence from physicians in recent years.",
        "Choice 4": "Political involvement has helped refute negative images portrayed in the media.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Nurses are trusted professionals and the largest health professional group. As such, they have political power to effect changes. If nursing were a small group, there would be little potential for power in shaping policies, even if all the other answers were true. Serving the public, while positive, does not necessarily help nurses to be influential in establishing health policy. Independence from physicians, although positive, does not necessarily make nurses influential in establishing healthcare policy. Refuting negative media, although positive, does not necessarily make nurses influential in establishing healthcare policy."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Nursing organization leaders think it is important to develop a definition of nursing to bring value and understanding to the profession, differentiate nursing activities from those of other health professionals, and help student nurses understand what is expected of them. A definition of nursing would not be likely to increase the number of informed people recruited into nursing. A definition of nursing would do little to improve the nurse’s role satisfaction. Although a definition of nursing might contribute to fighting stereotypes of nursing, other, more powerful influences (e.g., media portrayals) exist to counteract it."

        "Choice 4": "Both are regulated by the FDA.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Both traditional and complementary therapies can produce adverse effects in some patients. Many medications are derived from herbs, but the alternative treatments usually use the herbs, not prescription medication. Insurance programs do not necessarily reimburse alternative treatments, because many are not supported by sound scientific research methodology. Alternative medications are not regulated by the FDA."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "All of the options may be disadvantages to using NAPs, but making decisions based on another’s information is the greatest drawback because of the potential for negatively affecting patient care.

Acute care facilities focus on preventing illnesses and treating acute problems. These facilities include physicians’ offices, clinics, and diagnostic centers. Ambulatory care facilities provide outpatient care. Clients live at home or in nonhospital settings and come to the site for care. Ambulatory care facilities include private health and medical offices, clinics, surgery centers, and outpatient therapy centers. Extended care facilities typically provide long-term care, rehabilitation, wound care, and ongoing monitoring of patient conditions."

        "Choice 3": "Case method",
        "Choice 4": "Team",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The nurse is following the case method model of nursing care. In this model, one nurse cares for one patient during a single shift. When the functional nursing model is employed, care is compartmentalized, and each task is assigned to a staff member with the appropriate knowledge and skills. In primary nursing, one nurse plans the care for a group of patients round-the-clock. The primary nurse assesses the patient and develops the plan of care. When he or she is working, he or she provides care for those patients that he or she is responsible for. In his or her absence, the associate nurses deliver care. Although the nurse in this case could possibly be a primary nurse, there are not enough data to confidently infer that. If the team nursing approach is utilized, a licensed nurse (RN or LVN) is paired with a nursing assistant. The pair is then assigned to a group of patients."

        "Explanation": "The social worker coordinates services and counsels patients about financial, housing, marital, and family issues affecting healthcare. The occupational therapist helps patients regain function and independence for activities of daily living. Physician’s assistants work under the physician’s direction to diagnose certain diseases and injuries. Technologists provide a variety of specific functions in hospitals, diagnostic centers, and emergency care. For example, laboratory technologists aid in the diagnosis and treatment of patients by examining blood, urine, tissue, and body fluids. Radiology technologists perform x-rays and other diagnostic testing."

        "Choice 3": "Preferred provider organization",
        "Choice 4": "Employment-based private insurance",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Preferred provider organizations are a form of managed care that allows the patient a greater choice of providers, medications, and medical devices within the designated list. Health maintenance organizations allow the patient to choose a primary care provider within the organization to coordinate his care. This type of program will only reimburse medical care when the patient has first obtained a referral from the primary provider. Integrated delivery networks combine providers, healthcare facilities, pharmaceuticals, and services into one system, and the patient must remain within the system to receive care. Employment-based private insurance is not a managed care organization."

        "Choice 3": "Case manager",
        "Choice 4": "Traditional care model",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "This patient’s care is most likely being directed by a critical pathway. A critical pathway is a multidisciplinary approach to care that sequences interventions over a length of stay for a given case type, such as total abdominal hysterectomy. Using this model, the patient can be assisted out of bed as soon as her vital signs are stable. Using the traditional model, the nurse would have to obtain a physician’s order to assist the patient out of bed after surgery. The nursing care plan guides nursing care but cannot specify when the patient can get out of bed postoperatively without a physician’s order. When case management is used, care is coordinated by the case manager across the healthcare setting, but the case manager does not direct each care intervention."

Before the fall, she lived at home with her husband and managed their activities of daily living very well. The goal is for the patient to recover from the injury and return to her home. The hospital is ready to discharge her because she has exceeded the recommended length of stay in a hospital. However, she cannot walk or care for herself yet, and she will require lengthy physical therapy and further monitoring of her medications and her physical and mental status.

        "Explanation": "A skilled nursing facility primarily provides skilled nursing care for patients who can be expected to improve with treatment. For example, a patient who no longer needs hospitalization may transfer to a skilled nursing facility to get skilled care until she is able to return home. A nursing home provides custodial care for people, like this patient, who cannot live on their own but who are not sick enough to require hospitalization. It provides a room, custodial care, and opportunity for recreation. This patient cannot ambulate or perform activities of daily living, so outpatient therapy and home care would not be appropriate."

That best describes the nurse’s awareness that her bias can affect her patient care. Theoretical knowledge consists of information, facts, principles, and theories in nursing and related disciplines; it consists of research findings and rationally constructed explanations of phenomena.

Objective data can be observed by someone other than the patient (e.g., from physical assessments or lab and diagnostic tests). Subjective data are information given by the client. Blood pressure and heart rate measurements are both objective. “States . . . trouble sleeping and . . . drinks coffee . . .” are both subjective.

        "Explanation": "An ongoing assessment occurs when a previously identified problem is being reassessed—for example, taking an hourly temperature when a patient has a fever. Examining the mouth is a focused assessment to explore the patient’s complaint of sore throat. Asking for a pain rating is a focused assessment at the first complaint of pain. A detailed interview about exercise is a special needs assessment; there is no way to know if it is initial or ongoing."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "All are important techniques, but active listening focuses the attention on the patient and lets her know you are trying to understand her needs. The interviewer is more likely to get the patient to open up. Patients will forgive you for most errors in technique, but if they think you are not listening, that can negatively affect your relationship."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The most basic needs are centered on physiological survival—shelter (housing), food, and water. All other options are for higher needs. The order from most basic to highest level is physiologic, safety and security, love and belonging, esteem, and self-actualization. Loving relationships fall under the love and belonging category. Education is a form of self-actualization. Living in a crime-free neighborhood meets the need for safety and security."

        "Choice 1": "A nursing history focuses on the patient’s responses to the health problem.",
        "Choice 2": "The same information is gathered; the difference is in who obtains the information.",
        "Choice 3": "A nursing history is gathered using a specific format.",
        "Choice 4": "A medical history collects more in-depth information.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "A medical history focuses on the patient’s current and past medical/surgical problems. A nursing history focuses on the patient’s responses to and perception of the illness/injury or health problem, his coping ability, and resources and support. Nursing history formats vary depending on the patient, the agency, and the patient’s needs. Both nursing and medical histories typically use a specific format. A medical history does not necessarily contain more in-depth information. A nursing history can be in-depth, covering a wide range of topics, including biographical data, reason(s) patient is seeking healthcare, history of present illness, patient’s perception of health status and expectations for care, past medical history, use of complementary modalities, and review of functional ability associated with activities of daily living. Other topics might deal with nutrition, psychosocial needs, pain assessment, or other special needs topics."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Herbs and nutritional supplements can interact with prescription medications, and complementary and alternative treatments can interfere with conventional therapies. Physical assessment and laboratory tests are needed to assess a nutritional deficiency. To identify cultural and spiritual beliefs and well as what therapies are acceptable to the client, you need more than just information about nutritional and herbal supplements."

        "Choice 1": "They assess and cluster data into model categories.",
        "Choice 2": "They organize assessment data according to body systems.",
        "Choice 3": "They specify use of the nursing process to collect data.",
        "Choice 4": "They are based on the ANA Standards of Care.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "All the models categorize or cluster data into functional health patterns, domains, or categories. None of the assessment models clusters data according to body system. Assessment is the first step of the nursing process; the nurse does not use the entire nursing process in data collection. The ANA Standards of Care describe a competent level of clinical nursing practice based on the nursing process; nursing models are not based on the ANA Standards of Care."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Nondirective interviewing helps build rapport and facilitates open communication. Because it puts the patient in control, it can be very time-consuming (inefficient) and produce information that is not relevant. Directive interviewing should be used to focus anxious patients."

        "Choice 1": "“My patient is a young adult, so I plan to talk to her without her parents in the room.”",
        "Choice 2": "“Because my patient is old enough to be my grandfather, I will call him ‘Mr.’”",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "A patient should be comfortable when interviewing. The pain medication should have time to work before considering interviewing the patient, so asking questions when giving the medication is not a good idea. It is appropriate to interview patients without family/friends around. In nearly every culture, calling a patient Mr. or Mrs. shows respect and is therefore correct. Reading the patient’s health record is appropriate preparation for an interview."

A comprehensive assessment is holistic and is usually done upon admission to a healthcare facility. An ongoing assessment follows up after an initial database is completed or a problem is identified. A special needs assessment is performed when there are cues that more in-depth assessment is needed."

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "A functional assessment is most important because of discharge needs (e.g., self-care ability at home) and patient safety. A family and community assessment would be helpful to evaluate support systems, and a psychosocial assessment would be helpful to evaluate a patient’s understanding of and coping with his recent stroke. Remember that special needs assessments are lengthy and time-consuming, so they should be used only when in-depth information is needed about a topic."

        "Explanation": "When charting data, chart only what was observed, not what it meant. Inferences should not be made about a patient’s behavior during data collection (“he acted depressed”); so that response reflects the student’s lack of knowledge and need for teaching. Chart specific data, not vague phrases; the student is acknowledging the importance of this. There are no universally accepted phrases, just agency-approved abbreviations; the student is acknowledging the need to use agency-approved abbreviations. The student is correct that charting should be completed as soon after data collection as possible."

        "Explanation": "A possible nursing diagnosis is based on nursing knowledge, intuition, and experience and does not have enough data to support it; it is based on incomplete data. A risk diagnosis describes a problem that may develop in a vulnerable client if nursing care is not initiated to prevent it; it is made when risk factors are present in the data. Nurses collect data to support both risk and possible diagnoses; therefore, this statement does not differentiate them. A risk diagnosis becomes an actual diagnosis when symptoms develop."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Collaborative problems are physiological complications a client may be at risk for due to her medical diagnosis, medical treatment, or diagnostic studies. A collaborative problem requires monitoring by the nurse and intervention by a physician. A medical diagnosis requires interventions (medications, treatments) by the physician. Medical diagnoses do not direct all nursing care. Collaborative problems have the potential to become medical, not nursing, diagnoses."

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "All clinical inferences should be well supported by data. The more reliable data you gather, the more certain you can be that your inference is accurate. Because inferences are nursing diagnoses, it would be inappropriate to have a physician evaluate them. Although another experienced nurse could evaluate the inference, it still needs to be supported by sound and sufficient data. Even clients can validate clinical inferences in some situations, but adequate supporting data are still needed. Keep in mind that the client’s data might or might not be sufficient to “prove” the inference."

        "Choice 4": "Without supportive data",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "“Lazy” implies criticism of the client and therefore is judgmental. There need to be several (certainly more than two) etiological factors for the statement to be complex. There is no blame implied or harm resulting, so the statement is not legally questionable. There is no minimum “amount” of supportive data for a diagnosis and the stated etiology related to the nursing diagnosis. No supportive data are given in the stem of the question, so you could not choose “lack of data” as the best answer because all the options lack data as far as you can tell from the information given in the question. In addition, it is not necessary to include supportive data in the diagnostic statement (although some do prefer to use “A.M.B.” and include defining characteristics)."

        "Choice 1": "Differentiates the nurse’s role from that of the physician",
        "Choice 2": "Identifies a body of knowledge unique to nursing",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Benefits to nurses and nursing are that nursing diagnoses differentiate the nurse’s role, they identify a unique body of nursing knowledge, and some think they help nursing to develop a more professional image. However, the primary goal of nursing is to serve the good of the patient. Therefore, the most important use of a diagnosis is to specifically identify the client’s needs for quality nursing care."

        "Choice 1": "There is little research to support nursing diagnoses labels.",
        "Choice 2": "A perfect nursing diagnosis must be written for it to be useful.",

        "Choice 4": "Other professions do not recognize nursing diagnoses.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Best practice is evidence-based practice; that is, it is developed through sound, scientific research. Research is currently being conducted, but many of the diagnoses are not research based. A perfect nursing diagnosis is impossible to write, so that is not an issue. Having standardized nursing diagnoses recognized in state practice acts or by other professions has nothing to do with the value of the NANDA-I taxonomy."

        "Choice 4": "Identifies a client’s health problem",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Nursing diagnoses are statements that nurses use to describe a client’s physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, and social response to disease, injury, or other stressor. Diagnostic reasoning is used to identify the appropriate nursing diagnosis; it is not meant to “support” the diagnosis. A health problem is a condition that requires intervention to promote wellness or prevent illness; it is sometimes, but not always, a nursing diagnosis. Nursing diagnoses are not medical diagnoses."

        "Explanation": "The components of NANDA-I nursing diagnosis might include the following four parts: diagnostic label, defining characteristics, related factors, and risk factors. “Impaired Skin Integrity . . .” has the problem statement, etiology, and symptoms. For “Bowel Obstruction . . .” the problem is a medical diagnosis. The cause-and-effect order of “Inability to Ingest Food . . .” is incorrect; it starts with the etiology. The etiology and symptoms (A.M.B.) of “Caregiver Role Strain . . .” are reversed (alienation from family and friends are the symptoms that support the diagnosis)."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "If there are risk factors, it is not a possible diagnosis, it is a risk diagnosis. It is possible to have a “possible risk for” diagnosis. The patient with possible diagnoses may have symptoms, just not enough to support the diagnosis. Constipation is a nursing diagnosis, and the etiology is a defining characteristic for a risk diagnosis because it contributes to the problem. In risk diagnoses, the etiology consists of the risk factors."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "After identifying problems and etiologies (which this nurse has done), the nurse should verify them with the patient to help ensure that her conclusions are accurate. If the patient does not agree that he has Decisional Conflict, the nurse might interview him more to clarify the meaning of the data. Certainly the nurse could ask another nurse’s opinion, but that is not essential. It would make no sense to have a social worker interview the patient unless the situation remains unclear even after confirming with the client. If the nurse did have adequate theoretical knowledge of Decisional Conflict for this patient, she should have been informed by reading the NANDA-I handbook before making the diagnosis.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The diagnosis that best describes the overall health status is Fatigue. The only cue that might cause Fatigue is depression. You cannot use depression as the problem because it is a medical diagnosis, and it is not a NANDA-I label. The other cues (difficulty concentrating, inability to perform ADLs, and guilt) are symptoms of Fatigue, not etiologies. These diagnoses would lead the nurse to focus on dealing with guilt and confusion, so the source of the Fatigue would not be addressed."

A pain ranking of 5 is a symptom of pain, not an etiology, so it should be preceded by “A.M.B.” or “as manifested by.” Hip fracture is a medical diagnosis that is causing an etiology of pain; therefore, it should be preceded by “secondary to.” Risk diagnoses do not have symptoms, so it is not correct to put anything after “A.M.B.”"

        "Answer": "4, 2, 1, 3",
        "Explanation": "In Maslow’s hierarchy, physiologic needs and safety are the highest priority. Sleep is a basic physiologic need. Infection can threaten physical health. In this question, infection is not present; therefore, there is just a risk for it. Sleep Deprivation is an immediate problem that affects general physical, mental, and emotional health. Neither Anxiety nor Disturbed Body image is a physiologic or safety need. Anxiety is a more immediate need than Disturbed Body Image, so it probably deserves a higher ranking.

Both describe care needed by patients in defined situations, although unit standards usually describe care for groups of patients (e.g., all women admitted to a labor unit), and standardized care plans are often organized around a particular or all nursing diagnoses commonly occurring with a particular medical diagnosis.

The end product of formal planning is a holistic plan of care that addresses the patient’s unique problems and strengths; this nurse has no time to create a holistic plan of care. Ongoing planning refers to changes made in the plan as you evaluate the patient’s responses to care; no care has been given at this point.

Nearly all computer programs have a screen that allows you to type in interventions and nursing orders. It is the nurse’s responsibility to choose interventions: He cannot abdicate this responsibility and let the computer “choose.” As a professional, this nurse has already validated the data, nursing diagnosis, and goals, so he can feel reasonably certain that there is nothing wrong with the plan to that point. Although consultation with other nurses can be wise and prudent at times, the nurse caring for the patient would likely have the most familiarity with the healthcare needs and is in a better position to make sound judgments than another nurse who does not know the patient.

        "Explanation": "The nurse must recognize when she does not have the knowledge or skill needed to implement an order. Because the nurse is unfamiliar with the medication, that does not mean she should hold it and delay patient treatment. It is wisest to first consult with the pharmacist for information before administering the medication to ensure safe practice. Administering the medication as prescribed, without knowing its expected actions and side effects, at the least prevents adequate reassessment; at the most, it is dangerous. Holding the medication and notifying the prescriber prevents the client from receiving timely treatment—many drugs are less effective if a consistent schedule is not maintained. Asking another nurse to administer the medication is also unsafe because it cannot be assumed that the other nurse has the correct knowledge. In addition, the nurse caring for the client must assess for adverse reactions to the medication."

        "Explanation": "The implementation phase ends when you document nursing actions on the client’s chart.

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Positioning the client in the chair for meals considers the client’s desire to be out of bed for dinner, so it is obviously individualized. An intervention performed according to unit policy or protocols is not necessarily individualized. “Institute swallowing precautions” does not provide instructions for the specific actions needed to do that for “this particular” client."

        "Choice 2": "Gather the equipment and prepare it before informing the client about the procedure.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Before the nurse begins a procedure, she should review the care plan and look at the orders critically. Because this client is confused, she should ask a colleague to assist with the procedure to prevent undue stress for the client and nurse. The client should be informed about the procedure before the nurse gathers the equipment. Gathering the equipment and bringing it into the room before explaining the procedure might cause the client anxiety. Restraining the client should be done only as a last resort and to prevent client injury. Informing the primary provider that the procedure cannot be performed because the client is confused is inappropriate because the procedure can very likely be done with assistance."

        "Question": "A patient underwent surgery 3 days ago for colorectal cancer. The patient’s critical pathway states that he should participate in a teaching session with the wound ostomy nurse to learn colostomy self-care. The patient appears depressed and refuses to look at the colostomy or even make eye contact. How should the nurse proceed?",
        "Choice 1": "Postpone the teaching session until the patient is more receptive.",
        "Choice 2": "Follow the critical pathway for patient teaching about ostomy care.",
        "Choice 3": "Administer a prescribed antidepressant and notify the physician.",
        "Choice 4": "Explain to the patient the importance of skin care around the ostomy site.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "A depressed affect and poor eye contact likely indicate that the client is having difficulty coping with the new colostomy. At this time, the client would not be physically and psychologically ready to obtain the most benefit from teaching pertaining to ostomy care. Therefore, the nurse should postpone the teaching session for this client until the client is receptive to receiving the information. The nurse should not perform the teaching session simply because the critical pathway indicates it is appropriate. Simply administering an antidepressant does not address the client’s readiness to participate in a teaching session and ultimately self-care of the ostomy. The nurse should encourage the client to verbalize his feelings. Client education is not effective unless the client is receptive to the information. Readiness to learn is important. Proceeding with teaching when the client is struggling with coping is not sensitive to the client’s individual needs."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Determining the client’s main concerns promotes cooperation with the treatment regimen. For example, if the client is concerned about paying for diabetic monitoring equipment, he may disregard any teaching about the procedure. Although it is often important for a diabetic client to exercise and lose weight to control blood sugar levels, the client must want to do both. He will not exercise or lose weight simply because he is told to do so. The nurse must assess the client’s support systems and resources, not just tell him he must come to the diabetic clinic weekly. Some clients do not have access to transportation and, therefore, could not come to the clinic without social service intervention. Remember that knowledge does not necessarily change behavior."

Ongoing evaluation is performed while implementing, immediately after an intervention, or with each client contact; these are not necessarily scheduled events. Terminal evaluation is performed at the time of discharge. It describes the client’s health status and progress toward goals at that time.

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "A criterion is considered valid when it measures what it is intended to measure. Because anxiety is subjective (perceived by the patient), the best measure of anxiety is what the patient says about it. A relaxed facial expression and other physiological signs might or might not show the level of anxiety. Relaxation might occur, for example, because the patient is sleeping or falling asleep. The fact that a patient is not asking questions about his surgery could mean that he has adequate knowledge about the topic; it would not indicate the presence or absence of anxiety. All of the options except what the patient states could be measuring something other than anxiety."

        "Explanation": "The mother is exercising the right to self-determination. This refers to the right of the participant (or parent in the case of a minor) to withdraw from a research study at any time and for any reason. The right to not be harmed outlines the safety protocols of the study. All research participants also have the right to full disclosure. This guarantees the participants answers to questions, such as the purpose of the research study, the risks and benefits, and what happens if the patient feels worse as a result of the study. Moreover, participants also have the right to confidentiality. Typically that right is preserved by giving participants an identification code rather than associating them by name."

        "Explanation": "Toddlers have a fear of strangers, so it would be important to establish rapport before examining the child. Although talking to the mother before the child prior to a physical assessment does not lead to distrust, the action simply does not contribute to building a rapport with the child. Undressing the child before a trusting relationship is established often creates anxiety in the child, leading to uncooperativeness, fear, or withdrawal.

        "Explanation": "The primary task during Erikson’s stage 2, Autonomy Versus Shame and Doubt, is establishing an identity as separate from the parent/caregiver. A child between 18 months and 3 years typically tests the boundaries as part of exercising his will to control his environment. “No” is a declaration of independence and a bid for increased autonomy. Acts of independence and autonomy (e.g., refusing to hold her mother’s hand) are normal during this developmental stage. The toddler should be able to tolerate time away from her parents, delay gratification, and have elimination control. The other tasks are accomplished during the preschool stage."

        "Explanation": "Jaundice results from the breakdown of the maternal red blood cells that are in the baby’s system after birth, which elevates the bilirubin in the serum. If detergent caused a reaction, the reaction would commonly present as a rash. Although hepatitis B virus may pass through the placenta to the fetus, the infant does not typically show signs at 1 week of life.

Potty training is typically accomplished between 18 months and 3 years of age but is not a safety concern. It would be normal for a child at this age to be afraid of strangers. The child should be using utensils for most foods, but again it is not a safety concern."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Concerns about alcohol intake during adolescence is highest priority, regardless of whether or not it is stored in the home. Alcohol-related injury and death are a risk that should be avoided in every circumstance. Not having alcohol in the house does not guarantee the teenager won’t consume it with his friends. During the teen years, the relationships among peers strengthen and strongly influence adolescent behavior. Although the parents typically still maintain influence on the core values in the home, teens seek peers’ opinions for matters about social life or concerns of everyday living. As teens are developmentally concerned with appearance and social relationships, there can be an overemphasis on body image, leading to obesity, as well as eating disorders. Motor vehicle accidents are the leading cause of death for teenagers, typically due to distractibility, inattention, impulsiveness, and inexperience in various driving situations."

        "Explanation": "Both males and females experience a growth spurt during adolescence.

During this stage, a mature adult either continues to gain skills, be productive, and pass on his or her knowledge to the next generation or stagnates. During the middle years, many adults are realistic and insightful about age-related physical and emotional changes. Others experience difficulty coping with passing youth and advancing age.

Although all options may promote attachment, they are not absolutely necessary for bonding to occur. Mother-infant attachment is complex and involves all senses—not simply hearing the mother talk to him. There are physical and emotional benefits to breastfeeding, but it is not necessary for mother-infant attachment.

        "Explanation": "All are important topics to discuss with this age, but children of this age are very active, and injuries are common. Motor vehicle accidents are the most common cause of injury. They are just starting puberty, so sexual activity is still not usual. The discussion of appropriate food choices and getting enough sleep should be done throughout the child’s developmental stages; it is not peculiar to ages 10 to 12 years.

        "Question": "A 38-year-old client comes into the clinic for a health examination. Knowing the psychosocial development tasks and common health problems for this age group, it would be most important for the nurse to ask",
        "Choice 1": "If the client has episodes of feeling depressed",
        "Choice 2": "Whether the client practices safe sex",
        "Choice 3": "About the client’s exercise habits",
        "Choice 4": "About the health history of the client’s parents",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Striving to be self-sufficient and successful and to establish a career and family are the tasks for this age. These tasks are demanding and can be emotionally difficult and potentially cause depression. Untreated depression is a leading cause of death among young adults. Sexually transmitted infections are a risk for this age group but are not as severe a threat as depression. Exercise is important to overall health but is not a source of stress. There are genetic health problems that can impact the client, but the question is asking about psychosocial development and common health problems."

        "Question": "A mother watches the nurse perform an assessment on her newborn and asks the nurse why she is doing things like “stroking the bottom of his feet.” The nurse should respond in which of the following ways?",
        "Choice 1": "“I’m checking the blood flow to your baby’s feet to make sure it’s normal.”",
        "Choice 2": "“I’m testing to see if your baby’s neuromuscular system is fully developed.”",
        "Choice 3": "“I’m checking to see if your baby has the reflex responses we anticipate.”",
        "Choice 4": "“I’m testing to see if your baby has normal sensation in his feet.”",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The Babinski reflex is elicited by stroking upward of the side of the sole of the foot. This is one of several reflexes that should be present at birth. Stoking the bottom of the foot is not an assessment of circulation to the feet. The neuromuscular system is not fully developed at birth, but reflexes are present. Because an infant is not able to report sensation, which is a subjective finding, this is not the purpose of the nurse’s action."

        "Choice 1": "“I need to get screened for colon cancer.”",
        "Choice 2": "“I’ll start doing testicular self-exams.”",
        "Choice 3": "“I have to have my prostate checked.”",
        "Choice 4": "“I don’t need to do breast self-exams until I am 40.”",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Men may choose to perform monthly testicular exams until they are 40 years old. Colon cancer screening begins at age 50. Prostate exams are part of an annual health exam for middle adults. Even young adults should perform breast self-examination (although some practitioners question recommending it routinely). Whatever screening method is chosen, young adults do develop breast cancer; it is not a problem only for those past age 40."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Peers are increasingly more important to the school-age child. The child wants to have what his friends have. Pride in showing off new skills and possessions is normal for all stages of development, particularly during the preschool period. Friendships are typically between those the same sex at this age. A value system does not start to develop until adolescence."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Chronic diseases, including cancer, are major health problems for adults in the middle years. Habits for seat belt use should have already been established; although it may be important to reinforce seat belt use, the most important assessment is cancer screening. Eating disorders are more common in adolescence. In general, cognitive changes such as memory loss and dementia do not develop until older adulthood."

        "Choice 2": "Have one parent in the room to reassure the child during the interview.",
        "Choice 3": "Interview the child and each parent separately.",
        "Choice 4": "Request that a sexual assault nurse examiner (SANE) interview the family members.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Interviewing each family member separately allows the suspected victim more freedom to express concerns. An abused person may be afraid to talk with the abuser present and may even support the abuser’s version of events. If two adults accompany a child, the situation still does not allow such freedom, because it may be that one of the adults is abusing both the partner and child. The nurse should separate the caregivers and child to be certain they all tell the same story. A SANE is needed to perform the physical examination only if sexual abuse is suspected from the interview."

        "Explanation": "Only 3.3% of people 65 and over live in nursing homes; this rises to 15% for those over 85 years. In the United States, life expectancy at birth has risen dramatically in the past century: In 1900, average life expectancy was 49.2 years; in 2005, average life expectancy was 77.8 years. At age 65, white women led life expectancy with 20 years, followed closely by black women at 18.7 and white men at 17.2 years, whereas black men at age 65 had the lowest life expectancy at 15.2.

        "Choice 1": "“That is a realistic concern, as women do have a longer life expectancy than men. But many things can happen to change that.”",
        "Choice 2": "“You need not worry, because both you and your husband are white. That statistic is true only for black men and women.”",
        "Choice 3": "“It is true that women have a longer life expectancy at birth. However, life expectancy measured at age 65 is almost the same for both sexes. You are both well past 65.”",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "For infants born in 2005, the average total life expectancy for females is 80.4 years.\r\nLife expectancy measured at age 65 was nearly the same for men and women in 1900; however, women had a lead of about 3 years over men in 2005, narrowing the gap as men age. So the longer men live, the longer they will live. The statistics are true for white people as well as black people. The answer saying, “That is a realistic concern . . .” is only partially true. Women do have a longer life expectancy at birth, but that tends to almost disappear after men reach age 65, and it continues to lessen as they continue to age. In-migration and out-migration have nothing to do with gender differences in life expectancy, although they do affect the population distribution within a state, for example."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "With aging, there is decreased pupil accommodation, decreased tear production, and thickening of the lens of the eye. All of these contribute to impaired near vision (presbyopia). Decrease in pupil accommodation allows less light into the eye, so in order to read, the person needs a good light. However, there is also increased sensitivity to glare, so the light should have a glare-free bulb. The patient should try this first, since she already has new glasses. If this doesn’t help, then perhaps she should have the glasses rechecked. If her vision cannot be improved, then she could think about buying audio books and other ways to adapt to her difficulty reading."

        "Choice 1": "Naturally occurring retirement community",
        "Choice 2": "Retirement community",
        "Choice 3": "Continuing care retirement community",
        "Choice 4": "Assisted living facilities",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The scenario describes a retirement community. A naturally occurring retirement community is one in which the person ages in place, living in the same home as always and in a neighborhood where the neighbors have aged together and have provided support for each other through the years. A continuing care retirement community is residential living (e.g., cottages, cluster homes, apartments) into which a person must move. The person pays an entrance fee and monthly fees. In return, the contract provides for assistance with activities of daily living, coordinated social activities, health monitoring, and so on. There is usually a health clinic on site. Assisted living facilities (ALFs) are congregate residential settings that provide or coordinate personal services, 24-hour supervision and assistance (scheduled and unscheduled), activities, and health-related services. State regulations and level of services preclude residents from staying in an ALF when their needs become greater than the resources and services provided."

        "Question": "Identify one or more choices that best complete the statement or answer the question.\r\n1.A client is concerned about the age-related changes of her mother, who is 80 years old. Which statement(s) made by the client would likely represent a normal change of aging?",
        "Choice 1": "“My mother seems to get cold very easily.”",
        "Choice 2": "“My mother complains of her mouth being dry.”",
        "Choice 3": "“Mother goes around the house turning on all the lights.”",
        "Choice 4": "“Mother complains of leaking urine when she coughs.”",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 2, 3",
        "Explanation": "Incontinence is not a normal part of aging and should be explored further. The thinning of the layers of the skin causes older adults to feel cold—a normal part of aging. With aging, the brown fat layer, which contributes to generating and maintaining body temperature, becomes thinner as well. This is not the same type of fat as adipose, which is a white fat layer. Additionally, older adults who are sedentary often feel cooler. The elderly normally experience a decrease in saliva production, so although this is also a symptom of dehydration, dry mouth is a normal change of aging. Visual acuity decreases with age, but this, too, is a normal part of aging."

        "Question": "A client lives alone. He is very weak, stays in bed most of the time, and becomes fatigued after taking only two or three steps with a walker. His personal hygiene is poor. He moves very slowly when doing even small tasks, such as eating a meal. Which of the following are appropriate interventions for this patient? Choose all that apply; assume all are possible.",
        "Choice 1": "Arrange for a home aide to assist with activities of daily living.",
        "Choice 2": "Refer the client to a senior center for an adapted physical activity (APA) program.",
        "Choice 3": "Assess the patient for symptoms of depression and memory loss.",
        "Choice 4": "Arrange for nutritious meals to be delivered to the patient’s home.",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 3, 4",
        "Explanation": "This client has the characteristics of frailty: low physical activity, muscle weakness, fatigue, and slowed performance. Clearly, the client is not able to perform ADLs adequately; therefore, a home aide is needed. Adapted physical activity programs are designed for adults in better physical health, not for frail elders. The client would be unlikely to benefit from an APA and probably could not even participate in such a group activity. Depression and impaired mental abilities tend to accompany frailty, so it is important to assess those for this client. Nutrition is essential to slow the progression of frailty, so having meals delivered is both appropriate and important."

        "Choice 1": "The youngest age group makes up the base of the pyramid.",
        "Choice 2": "Men are on the left side of the pyramid and women on the right.",

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 2",
        "Explanation": "Age distribution of a population is often illustrated in a pyramid, with the youngest age group (0–4) at the base and the oldest age group (85+) at the peak, and men on the left of the figure and women on the right. The shape of a population pyramid changes to rectangle in developed countries with fewer births and increased life expectancy. The length of a bar does not indicate the absolute number of people in a category; it indicates the proportion of the total population represented by that category."

        "Choice 1": "Assess for hearing deficit at the beginning of the interaction.",
        "Choice 2": "Speak in a more loudly than normal, and at a slightly higher pitch.",
        "Choice 3": "Pay special attention to cues from body language.",

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 3, 4",
        "Explanation": "The nurse should check for sensory deficits at the beginning of the interaction so he can allow for lip reading, as needed. Because older adults sometimes have difficulty expressing themselves, body language (e.g., wringing hands, fidgeting) is especially important. Because older adults process information slowly, the nurse should speak slowly, allowing them to formulate their answers. Speaking slowly does not mean the nurse should speak loudly or at a higher pitch. Many older adults have high-pitch hearing loss."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "2, 3",
        "Explanation": "Because of changes in bladder capacity and changes in blood flow to the kidneys, many older adults wake at least once during the night to void. Sexual response changes are also normal; it is common for older adult men to have less firm erections. A man who has difficulty starting his urine stream and voiding likely has an enlarged prostate, which is physiologically not normal. Burning on urination is indicative of a bladder infection and is not normal."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The patient’s environment can help nourish wellness. Helping the patient designate a corner of the room to display personal mementos can be healing and help the patient cope with the prolonged hospitalization. The other interventions might be helpful to the patient but are not as helpful in specifically dealing with “hospitalization” as is designating a portion of the room that is uniquely hers."

        "Explanation": "When a patient is faced with a terminal illness, spirituality can help the patient maintain his sense of self. Family relationships can provide a loving, supportive source of comfort and reassurance but can sometimes cause the patient pain and a feeling of loneliness when faced with a terminal illness. Nutrition, sleep, and rest are healing but usually not as helpful to a patient with terminal illness as is spirituality."

        "Explanation": "Mental illness is associated with a stigma that is usually a barrier, and even considered a debilitating handicap. Chronic urinary incontinence is not commonly associated with urinary tract infection, and nothing in the scenario suggests that the patient is incontinent. The patient is at risk for recurring urinary tract infections, but this is not considered a debilitating handicap. Auditory hallucinations are associated with schizophrenia but have not been described as the most debilitating handicap."

        "Question": "Many health providers define illness as pathology; however, people experience, rather than define, illness. Which of the following is how most people experience illness?",
        "Choice 1": "“Feeling lousy,” a true sense of not being all right",
        "Choice 2": "A change in the way they feel or a disruption in their typical life",
        "Choice 3": "Something to be dreaded and avoided if at all possible",
        "Choice 4": "An experience that offers the potential for learning and spiritual growth",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "People typically describe their illness in terms of how it makes them feel or the effect it has on day-to-day life. “Feeling lousy” is inappropriate as many people do not feel “lousy” when they are ill. For example, hypertension is an illness that may have no symptoms. Similarly, patients may have chronic disease that is well managed and therefore does not make them feel ill. “Something to be dreaded and avoided . . .” is also not accurate. If a person has an external locus of control, he may view illness as a consequence of actions taken. From this viewpoint, he may have little control over whether he can avoid illness. Finally, although some people do grow and learn in the face of illness, most people do not hold such a positive view about illness—and the question asks how people experience illness."

        "Choice 1": "An unhealthy physical environment, characterized by poor living conditions, always has a negative effect on an individual’s health",
        "Choice 2": "Adequate income, food, and shelter create a healthful environment and always improve physical health status",
        "Choice 3": "Physical environment, family, and social support may help or hinder the health status of an individual",
        "Choice 4": "The environment that should always be assessed is the client’s immediate surroundings; extended boundaries do not apply in an ill state",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The home environment, community, family, friends, and support system all influence health status. The balance among these variables has a net positive or negative effect on a client’s health status. The effect of poor living conditions may be offset by the presence of loving family and friends. Poverty does not always have a negative effect on health. Similarly, the presence of food, shelter, and clothing does not always convey protective health, as loneliness and hopelessness may counteract these positive influences. When examining the client’s environment, extended boundaries must be considered, especially when providing community-based care."

        "Choice 1": "You cannot use this information at all. People are innately hardy or not. This is something that you must merely recognize.",
        "Choice 2": "You should encourage all people to develop some level of hardiness in order to get through difficult physical and emotional times.",
        "Choice 3": "You should assess for your own level of hardiness: If you are hardy, you will be a better nurse; if you are not, you can learn more about hardiness.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Hardiness is a personality trait that helps many cope with stress and illness. As a personality trait, it is unlikely that you can teach or otherwise encourage this trait. Awareness of your own level of hardiness will help you understand your response to stress, but hardiness does not necessarily make you a better nurse."

The nurse is responsible for hooking up and checking special equipment such as suction. The nurse would need to tell the NAP whether the patient is to be admitted ambulatory, by wheelchair, or by stretcher to know whether to position the bed high or low."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Notifying the patient and family well in advance of the transfer allows them time to adjust emotionally and to make any necessary plans. A copy of the records is usually sent, and the nurse does coordinate the transfer with the receiving facility; however, that does very little to assist with the patient’s emotional status or planning. Someone from the hospital may accompany the patient to the car; or if the transfer is by ambulance, perhaps not.

She calls her mother and tells her she is ill and asks if her mother can care for the children. Which stage of illness behavior is she experiencing? Choose all that apply.",
        "Choice 1": "Sick-role behavior",
        "Choice 2": "Dependence on others",
        "Choice 3": "Seeking professional care",
        "Choice 4": "Experiencing symptoms",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The 36-year-old mother is assuming sick-role behavior because she is identifying herself as ill. She is also in the stage of experiencing symptoms; she is experiencing symptoms and realizes that illness is starting, even though she has not yet entered the stages of dependence and seeking professional care. By telling her mother of the illness, she is relieved of her normal duties—caring for her children. Dependence on others occurs when the client accepts a diagnosis and treatment from the healthcare provider. Seeking professional care occurs after the sick-role behavior stage. During this stage, the client makes the decision that she is ill and that professional healthcare is needed."

        "Choice 1": "Aldosterone",
        "Choice 2": "Thyroid-stimulating hormone",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Endorphins act like opiates to produce a sense of well-being; they are released by the hypothalamus and posterior pituitary gland in response to alarm. Aldosterone promotes fluid retention by increasing the reabsorption of water by renal tubules. Thyroid-stimulating hormone increases the efficiency of cellular metabolism and fat conversion to energy for cell and muscle needs. Adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulates the adrenal cortex to produce and secrete glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids."

        "Explanation": "Physiological responses in the exhaustion stage include low blood pressure and high respiratory and heart rates.

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "During the shock phase of the general adaptation syndrome, large amounts of epinephrine prepare the body to react in an emergency situation.

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Immediately after the injury, the vascular response occurs. Blood vessels at the site constrict to control bleeding. After the injured cells release histamine, the vessels dilate, causing increased blood flow to the area. During the next phase, known as the cellular response phase, white blood cells migrate to the site of injury. In the exudate-formation phase, the fluid and white blood cells move from circulation to the site of injury, forming an exudate. Tissue regeneration occurs in the healing phase."

Anger is not a nursing diagnosis. Fear, which is also a nursing diagnosis, is an emotion or feeling of apprehension from an identified danger, threat, or pain.

A stethoscope, dangling jewelry, or anything else the patient might use as to harm the nurse should be removed before entering the patient’s room. It is unlikely that a stethoscope would cause the patient not to trust the nurse, nor function as a stressor because stethoscopes are common in the healthcare setting; nearly every caregiver carries a stethoscope.

        "Question": "Two days after a patient undergoes abdominal surgery, his surgical incision is red and slightly edematous; it is oozing a small amount of serosanguineous (pink-tinged serous) fluid. On the basis of these data, what can you conclude? Choose all that apply.",
        "Choice 1": "The wound is most likely infected.",
        "Choice 2": "This is a vascular response to inflammation.",
        "Choice 3": "Damaged cells are being regenerated.",
        "Choice 4": "Exudate formation is occurring.",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "2, 4",
        "Explanation": "During the vascular response phase of the inflammatory process, blood vessels constrict to control bleeding. Fluid from the capillaries moves into tissues, causing edema. The fluid and white blood cells that move to the site of injury are called exudates; this includes the serosanguineous exudate that commonly appears at surgical incisions. When a wound becomes infected, yellow, foul-smelling drainage may form at the site; there is no mention of pus in the scenario. Regeneration occurs when identical or similar cells replace damaged cells; although this may be occurring, you cannot prove it with the data given here."

The patients described in the other options will naturally have some difficulty adjusting to their body image change, but it should not be as great because the physical changes are more gradual, which allows for adaptation over time."

        "Explanation": "The adolescent with average appearance who had an appendectomy is likely to have a positive body image because the adolescent suffered an acute, reversible illness. Those born with physical handicaps are less likely to have a positive body image because many times the handicap leaves them socially isolated.

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The patient’s wife is most likely experiencing inter-role conflict, in which her role as a mother and worker are making competing demands on her. Role strain is a mismatch between role expectations and role performance. Interpersonal role conflict results when another person’s idea about how a role should be performed differs from that of the person who is performing the role.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The nurse should involve a mental health professional immediately, because the patient is exhibiting signs of a disabling anxiety disorder. Although it is important for the nurse to provide emotional support for the patient, a mental health professional is needed for this patient. Doing nothing is neglectful. Questioning the patient’s family about the information violates the patient’s right to privacy, unless the nurse obtains the patient’s permission to do so."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Decisional Conflict is the most appropriate nursing diagnosis for this patient because he is uncertain about whether he should take the surgical risk. Death Anxiety is apprehension, worry, or fear related to death or dying; there is nothing to suggest that this patient is suffering from Death Anxiety at this time. Powerlessness is a perceived lack of control over a current situation; this patient is trying to exert some control over his care. Ineffective Denial is appropriate when the patient consciously or unconsciously rejects knowledge; there is nothing in this scenario to suggest that the patient is rejecting knowledge."

        "Explanation": "Tearfulness, regression, restlessness, agitation, withdrawal, past or present substance abuse, and a past history of suicide attempts are all behavioral symptoms of depression. Denial of feelings, anger, anxiety, guilt, helplessness, hopelessness, and sadness are affective findings associated with depression.

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Depression is often masked in older adults and expressed as physical and personality changes. Memory loss and confusion are also common symptoms of depression in older adults. Any one of the symptoms might occur as a result of physical illness, but the combination should prompt the nurse to suspect depression and interview and screen for it before exploring physiological causes for the symptom (as with a urine specimen). Placing the patient with another patient would be indicated for social isolation, which can be associated with depression; however, the nurse needs to screen for depression before looking for causes."

The history and nursing observations indicate that the patient",

        "Explanation": "In dementia, a patient’s language is disoriented, rambling, and incoherent and the patient responds to questions inappropriately or with “near misses.” Speaking slowly and being slow to respond to verbal stimuli are signs of depression, and in depression, the patient usually answers questions appropriately. Awakening early and sleeping constantly during the day are signs of depression; in dementia, sleep is fragmented and the person awakens often during the night. Difficulty concentrating on details is a thinking pattern seen more in depression; in dementia, there is difficulty finding words, difficulty calculating, and decreased judgment."

        "Choice 4": "Encourage liberal visiting hours by the friend and the patient’s children.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The nurse can best intervene by involving the friend and the patient’s children in the patient’s care, discharge planning, and home care. The friend may or may not be able to care for the patient at home. But if planning to provide home care, the patient’s friend should be informed of the patient’s needs while in the hospital and have an opportunity to participate prior to discharge. The nurse can involve the friend with the patient’s consent without infringing on the patient’s privacy. Her name needs to be listed on the patient privacy (HIPAA) form. The nurse should also encourage liberal visiting hours by the friend and the patient’s children if it is beneficial for the patient’s recovery; however, comprehensive involvement in care is more inclusive than simply liberalizing visiting hours and therefore is the best answer."

Middle-age adults typically begin experiencing signs and symptoms associated with long-standing, unhealthy behaviors. Therefore, consuming a low-fat diet and limiting the intake of alcohol and tobacco are likely appropriate topics to include in the teaching plan for a middle-aged adult.

        "Explanation": "Reduced compliance with community immunization in the United States increases the risk for diseases, such as polio, that were thought to be eradicated. For vaccines to be effective, the population needs to receive them. Bioterrorism involves the introduction of a highly infectious microbe for which there is no protection to the population. Polio is not such a threat because immunization is available. Vaccinations are available through governmental programs for those who do not have health insurance. Drug resistance has led to the reemergence of tuberculosis, which was previously cured with antibiotics."

        "Explanation": "The nurse cares for this patient by becoming familiar with the patient’s individual cultural and ethnic beliefs and values. It is helpful to become familiar with the patient’s ethnic group and the Spanish-speaking community; however, the nurse should not assume that the individual holds the same values, beliefs, and practices as his ethnic group or community. The nurse should explore her own culture but not assume that the patient holds those same beliefs and practices."

        "Explanation": "Knowing an action is needed but giving reasons for not beginning it “just now” shows a focus on the present. The patient knows that he should reduce his sodium intake, but his present situation is preventing him from doing so. Therefore, he is disregarding the impact consuming sodium might have on his future.

        "Explanation": "Patients of Japanese heritage may view pain as a virtue and a matter of family honor. They may be more accepting of pain medications if the nurse reassures them that pain control enhances healing. Patients of Mexican heritage may view pain as punishment for immoral behavior. Those of Navajo Indian heritage commonly view pain as a part of life, whereas those of Puerto Rican heritage may feel that pain is best treated with herbal teas and prayer.

        "Explanation": "This patient is exhibiting sexism; she is objecting to the nurse merely because of his sex. Although we tend to think of sexism in a negative light, this woman may merely be reflecting a cultural attitude. The patient is in no position to actually discriminate against the nurse, in terms of employment, and so on. Therefore, her preferences should be respected. Ethnocentrism occurs when a person is positively biased toward their own culture. Racism is a form of prejudice and discrimination based on race.

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Powerlessness is the best nursing diagnosis for the patient who is unable to make healthcare personnel understand the importance of his cultural beliefs. Impaired Verbal Communication can be used for patients who do not speak or understand the healthcare personnel’s language. Spiritual Distress might occur because a treatment is not in agreement with the patient’s religious beliefs.

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "An archetype is an example of a person or thing—something that is recurrent—and it has its basis in facts. Therefore, it becomes a symbol for remembering some of the culture specifics and is usually not negative. A bias is the tendency to see only one side of an issue, a lack of impartiality. Prejudice refers to negative attitudes toward other people that are based on faulty and rigid stereotypes about race, gender, sexual orientation, and so on. A cultural stereotype is the unsubstantiated belief that all people of a certain racial or ethnic group are alike in certain respects. Similar to biases, a stereotype may be positive or negative."

Culture exists at many levels that are both material and nonmaterial. Cultural customs, beliefs, attitudes, and practices are not static but change over time at different rates, depending on current events, other significant people, and social influences.

        "Explanation": "Patients of Japanese heritage commonly avoid opioid use; however, they sometimes reconsider after healthcare personnel explain that they improve the healing process. When the patient continues to refuse pain medications despite explanation, the nurse should respect the patient’s wishes and utilize nonpharmacological measures to control pain. The nurse should document that the patient wishes to avoid opioid use in the nurses’ notes. The nurse should continue to assess pain levels in this patient at the same frequency as before.

There are many reasons the woman may prefer a female nurse: she may be very modest, or she may be prejudiced against male nurses, for example. Hospital policy might state that, to prevent discrimination issues, nursing assignments should not be made based on the gender of the patient or nurse. However, even if this is so, before explaining this to the patient, the charge nurse should explore the patient’s beliefs and make special arrangements with hospital administration to uphold the patient’s beliefs, if possible. Telling the patient that each nurse is capable of providing care is not sensitive to the patient and her beliefs.

        "Explanation": "Orthodox Jews require an alternative to the oral route of drug administration on Yom Kippur to comply with their religious beliefs. Therefore, the nurse should ask the physician to change the route of administration. Administering the medication as prescribed breaks the patient’s religious tradition on the holiest day of the Jewish calendar. Holding the medication until after Yom Kippur delays treatment and may cause harm to the patient; furthermore, it is not within the scope of nursing practice to hold medications that have been prescribed by a physician.

Rastafarians typically consume tea, but some do not drink milk or coffee. Muslim women may wear a locket containing religious writing around the neck in a small leather bag.

        "Explanation": "The nurse can best deliver spiritual care by developing a greater awareness of her own spirituality. This allows the nurse to be a better listener and provide better care for the patient. The nurse should avoid assuming that a patient who shares the same religious affiliation has the same beliefs.

People who practice Hinduism do not typically practice Western medicine, chiropractic medicine, or Qigong. Qigong, a form of Chinese martial arts, is used to achieve healing through focus on the body’s energy centers."

        "Question": "A patient tells the nurse, “I feel that God has abandoned me. I am so angry that I can’t even pray.” The patient refuses to see his clergyman when he calls. Which is the most appropriate nursing diagnosis for this patient?",
        "Choice 1": "Spiritual Distress",
        "Choice 2": "Risk for Spiritual Distress",
        "Choice 3": "Impaired Religiosity",
        "Choice 4": "Moral Distress",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "This patient exhibits three defining characteristics for Spiritual Distress (feeling abandoned by God, inability to pray, refusing to see a religious leader). Therefore, the actual problem of Spiritual Distress exists, not the potential problem of Risk for Spiritual Distress. Impaired Religiosity is difficulty in exercising or impaired ability to exercise reliance on beliefs or to participate in rituals of a faith tradition (e.g., going to church). This patient is not unable to see the clergyman but chooses not to. Moral Distress occurs when a person makes a moral decision but is prevented from carrying out the chosen action."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "One of the steps of most values-clarification processes is to list values (what is important and not important in one’s life) and the time commitment for each. The nurse facilitates this by asking reflective, clarifying questions of the patient. Values clarification does not necessarily directly enhance self-esteem, inspire hope, or provide spiritual support, although it can indirectly contribute to development of spiritual identity."

        "Choice 2": "Begin the prayer with “Jehovah God” as she always does while avoiding the name of Jesus.",
        "Choice 3": "Avoid saying any name for the Supreme Being while praying and quote an Old Testament Bible scripture as the prayer.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Ask how the patient prefers to address the Divine. Some people prefer the use of parental language in their prayers; for example, Father God or Divine Mother. Some use the names Jehovah, Yahweh, or Allah. Hindus may address one or more of multiple gods, each of whom has several names. So seek direction from the patient in these matters: Most people are honored to be able to explain their beliefs and practices to someone who is open to the experience. The nurse should not assume that using the names Jesus and Jehovah God would be supportive to the patient, although they might not offend in any way. The nurse does not need to avoid addressing God by a name, but the most supportive way to do so is to find out the name the patient wishes to use. Furthermore, the nurse should not assume that the patient would find a New Testament Bible verse to be helpful spiritually."

Which of the following would indicate that progress is being made toward achieving compliance with healthcare therapy? (Choose all that apply.) The patient says",
        "Choice 1": "“I will try to pray more often for stronger faith that God will heal me.”",

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "2, 3",
        "Explanation": "Agreeing to consider treatment (“think about it”) and recognizing that sometimes faithful people are not cured both suggest that the patient is at least considering that it is all right for her to question her beliefs. Praying for stronger faith in God’s healing suggests that she is holding strong in her belief that she will be healed if she only has enough faith. Having “no confusion” about the right thing to do would be evidence of problem resolution, provided the “right thing” to do is to take the medication. However, you need more information to know if that is what the patient means. It could just as easily mean that she is more sure than ever that she should not take the medication."

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Although it is impossible to predict with certainty and the grieving process is highly individual and personal, in general those who suffer a sudden loss typically have more difficult grieving than those who have had the time to prepare for the death. Family and friends of persons with chronic illnesses (e.g., cancer) have usually had time to emotionally prepare for the death, initiate the funeral and burial arrangements, and begin the grieving process before the death occurs."

        "Choice 1": "“Certainly, go ahead; your husband will most likely hold on until you return.”",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The patient is exhibiting signs that typically occur days to a few hours before death. The nurse should provide information to the wife so she can make an informed decision about whether to leave her husband’s bedside. The nurse should not offer false reassurance by stating that the patient will most likely be fine until the wife’s return. The nurse should not offer her opinion by telling the wife that she needs to take care of herself. It is also unrealistic for the nurse to stay with the patient until his wife returns. The nurse would be minimizing the wife’s concern by telling her not to worry because her husband is in good hands. The issue for the family member is not trust in the competency of the healthcare provider but rather wanting to be present with her spouse at the time of death."

Turning the patient to prevent skin breakdown and promote comfort is also important, but it does not take priority over administering pain medications. The patient may not be able to eat meals or get out of bed into the chair and may tolerate only small amounts at a meal.

The Patient Care Partnership is a document that helps to ensure that patients receive quality care.

Nasotracheal suctioning and inserting a nasopharyngeal airway are ineffective against a “death rattle” and may cause the patient unnecessary discomfort.

        "Explanation": "Rigor mortis develops 2 to 4 hours after death; therefore, the nurse should place dentures in the mouth and close the patient’s eyes and mouth before that time. The nurse should place a pillow under the head and shoulders to prevent blood from settling there and causing discoloration. Closing the patient’s mouth and tying a strip of soft gauze under the chin and around the head keeps the mouth set in a natural position for a viewing later. Closing the eyes after death creates a peaceful resting appearance when the body is later viewed but has nothing to do with setting the mouth. Placing dentures in the mouth and closing the eyes and mouth do not prevent discoloration in the facial area."

        "Question": "Throughout the course of his illness, a patient has denied its seriousness, even though his health professionals have explained prognosis of death very clearly. Physiologic signs now indicate that he will probably die within a short period of time, but he is still firmly in a state of emotional denial. The patient says to the nurse, “Tell my wife to stop hovering and go home. I’m going to be fine.” How should the nurse respond?",
        "Choice 1": "“Your physical signs indicate that you will likely not live more than a few more days.”",
        "Choice 2": "“You seem very sure that you are not going to die. Please tell me more about what you are feeling.”",
        "Choice 3": "“It seems to me you would be feeling some anger and wondering why all this is happening to you.”",
        "Choice 4": "“It would be best for your family if you were able to work through this and come to accept the reality of your situation.”",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Not all patients go through all the traditional stages of grieving. It is not the nurse’s responsibility to move patients sequentially through each stage of the dying and grieving process with the goal that everyone ends life accepting death. It is a nursing responsibility to accept and support people “where they are” and help them to express their feelings. Nurses need to understand patients, not change them. In this situation, denial may be very important to this patient, as an emotional defense and coping strategy.\r\n“You seem sure . . . tell me . . . what you are feeling” restates what the patient has said (indicating understanding) and encourages expression of feelings—both are supportive. Even though moving him through stages is not the goal in this situation, support does facilitate that.\r\nTelling the patient that his physical signs indicate that death is imminent is presenting truth and reality; however, the exact time of death is not always predictable. Forecasting the hour of death can have negative impact on the family as they anticipate the event with emotion and exhaustion. Presenting reality is appropriate in certain circumstances earlier in the dying process, but not in this situation because it has already been tried with no change in the patient. Presenting reality does not support the patient’s needs at this time.\r\nSaying “It seems to me you would be feeling some anger . . .” is directed toward moving the patient from denial and suggesting he should feel something he has not yet expressed. This is not therapeutic. Saying “It would be best for your family . . .” presumes that the nurse knows more about what is “best” for the patient’s family than the patient himself. This statement is also judgmental."

        "Question": "A home health patient previously lived with her sister for more than 20 years. Although it has been over a year since her sister died, the patient tells the nurse, “It’s no worse now, but I never feel any relief from this overwhelming sadness. I still can’t sleep a full night. The house is a mess; I feel too tired, even to take a bath.

        "Choice 1": "Grieving longer than usual because of the closeness of the relationship with her sister",
        "Choice 2": "Experiencing a depressive disorder rather than simply grieving the loss of her sister",
        "Choice 3": "Feeling guilt and worthlessness because her sister died and she is still alive",
        "Choice 4": "Interpreting the holiday as a trigger event, which is causing her to hallucinate",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The patient is likely experiencing a depressive disorder. Her symptoms include unrelieved, overwhelming sadness; insomnia; difficulty carrying out ADLs; fatigue; and visual hallucinations. Note that her sadness is pervasive, not created by a trigger event (holiday). Of those symptoms, insomnia is common to both grief and depression, but the other symptoms are signs of depressive disorder. There is, of course, no “correct” timeline for what constitutes “longer than usual” grieving; however, the patient’s symptoms are typical of depression, not grief. She has not said she feels guilty or worthless, and there is nothing from which the nurse could infer that. She has specifically said that the holiday has not made her feel any worse—that is, it has not been a trigger event."

        "Explanation": "Vital signs are one indicator of a client’s physiological status, but they are not an absolute indicator of well-being from every aspect. It may be inaccurate to state that the vital signs indicate the infection is resolved; vital signs could stabilize even if the infection remains active. The healthcare provider’s decision regarding the client’s readiness for discharge is not based exclusively on the vital signs but rather is based on a compilation of other sources of information, primarily the client’s clinical status, but also cultures, complete blood counts, and various other laboratory and possibly radiologic evidence. Although the nurse will need to continue monitoring the temperature, other clinical signs must also be monitored; therefore, the statement “We still need to keep monitoring your temperature . . .” is incomplete and less useful than the statement that begins “Your vital signs are stable, but . . .”"

For oral, axillary, and rectal temperatures, there is a 1°F degree difference between each site and the next higher one. However, mathematical conversions between sites are not reliable and should be used only when a rough estimate is needed—for instance, to decide whether a reading needs to be validated by another site or another thermometer.

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "All are important things to include in client education, but self-monitoring of blood pressure is of little value unless it is done using proper technique. Requesting that the client demonstrate the procedure would allow the nurse to evaluate the client’s technique."

Four hours later, the vital signs are as follows: oral temperature 103.2°F (38.5°C), heart rate 76 beats/min, respiratory rate 14 breaths/min, and blood pressure 120/66 mm Hg. Which should be the nurse’s first intervention at this time?",
        "Choice 1": "Ask the client if he has had a warm drink in the last 30 minutes.",
        "Choice 2": "Notify the primary care provider of the client’s temperature.",
        "Choice 3": "Ask the client if he is feeling chilled.",
        "Choice 4": "Take the temperature by a different route.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "With a fever, the heart rate and respiratory rate are usually elevated. In this case, they are within normal limits, so the nurse should wonder about the accuracy of the temperature reading and validate it in some way. Because having a hot drink is a common cause of false readings, the nurse should determine whether that has occurred before retaking or otherwise validating the reading."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Blood pressure fluctuates a great deal during the day and is influenced by age, sex, activity, and many other factors. Any determination of hypertension must be done after two or more BP readings taken on separate occasions. The type of manometer does not greatly influence the reliability of BP readings, although the mercury manometer is more accurate. Only the first and last Korotkoff sounds are necessary to determine a BP reading. The first time BP is assessed for a patient, the nurse should compare the reading in the left and right arm; however, this is not specific to evaluating for hypertension."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "A single lifestyle change, such as weight loss, can lower blood pressure (BP). Whenever the client has an elevated BP, the reading should be monitored even when it occurs just occasionally. Drinking too much alcohol is associated with hypertension, but water consumption is not unless accompanied by high sodium intake. A diet high in calcium is recommended to prevent and manage hypertension; therefore, it is not advisable to limit the intake of dietary calcium found in dairy products."

        "Choice 1": "Counting the rate for 1 full minute",
        "Choice 2": "Exposing only the left side of the chest",

        "Choice 4": "Using your ring finger to palpate the intercostal spaces",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Apical pulse is generally indicated for patients with cardiac conditions or who are taking cardiac medications. Often they have irregular heartbeats or slow rates. A more accurate count is obtained when such heartbeats are counted for a full minute. Exposing the chest is, of course, necessary; exposing only the left side protects the patient’s privacy but does not improve the accuracy. The nurse should know why an apical pulse is indicated, but this would not affect the accuracy of the count. Which finger the nurse uses to palpate depends on which hand is used. Even if the nurse failed to use the index or ring finger, this would be unlikely to affect the accuracy of the counting."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Respiratory rate 26 breaths/min and shallow. Acute pain causes an increase in respiratory rate but a decrease in depth. Elevated temperature does not indicate pain. The apical pulse is lower than normal, but because the pulse increases with pain, a rate of 56 beats/min does not indicate pain. A blood pressure of 124/82 mm Hg is within normal limits. Blood pressure usually elevates temporarily with acute pain; it may decrease over time with unremitting chronic pain."

        "Choice 1": "Ask the client when in the day dizziness occurs.",
        "Choice 2": "Help the client to assume a recumbent position.",
        "Choice 3": "Measure both heart rate and blood pressure with the client standing.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Dizziness upon standing is a symptom of orthostatic hypotension. The nurse should obtain orthostatic vital signs (measure pulse and blood pressure with the patient supine, sitting, and standing) to assess for orthostatic hypotension. The time of day is irrelevant to the diagnosis. If the nurse observes the patient become dizzy upon standing, the first action would be to help the client lie down and then obtain orthostatic vital signs; but this is not necessary when the symptom is not present. The nurse needs to measure both the heart rate and the blood pressure but not only in the standing position."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 3",
        "Explanation": "If ice packs are used, they are applied to the groin, neck, or axillae. A fever increases metabolic needs, so fluids are necessary to prevent dehydration. A blanket would help with heat retention. A tympanic thermometer is not appropriate when an accurate temperature is needed, as when a client has a fever."

        "Explanation": "Impaired Communication is the preferred nursing diagnosis when the patient is unfamiliar with the dominant language. Impaired Verbal Communication is an appropriate diagnosis for the patient with expressive or receptive aphasia. Readiness for Enhanced Communication is appropriate when the patient expresses willingness to enhance communication.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "This patient is experiencing Acute Confusion caused by lack of oxygen related to his respiratory distress. As a young adult with an acute episode of asthma, this patient would not likely have a history of confusion; therefore, without more data, Chronic Confusion is not an appropriate diagnosis for this patient. Impaired Verbal Communication is an appropriate diagnosis for the patient with expressive or receptive aphasia, but not with confusion. Readiness for Enhanced Communication is appropriate when the patient expresses willingness to enhance communication."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "An appropriate outcome for a patient with expressive aphasia is “uses alternative methods of communication.” Expressive aphasia means the patient cannot verbalize his intended message, but the patient may be able to understand and to communicate in other ways. “Communicates effectively using a translator” is an appropriate outcome for a patient who is unfamiliar with the dominant language. “Interprets messages accurately” and “follows commands when asked” are appropriate outcomes for the patient with receptive, not expressive, aphasia."

        "Choice 4": "Passive",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "This patient is using a passive communication style to avoid conflict with others while allowing the other person to be in control. An aggressive approach forces others to relinquish control. The goal of the aggressive approach is to win and be in control. With assertive communication, the person expresses beliefs or feelings without infringing on another’s rights. The passive aggressive approach uses a submissive style of communication but is aggressive in the sense that it manipulates the receiver to help the sender win. This allows the sender to be in control without conflict."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "By stating that pain must be assessed and documented for every patient, the nurse manager is using an assertive approach. An assertive approach uses the statement of facts, not judgments. Asking why the nurse has not been assessing and documenting pain is judgmental and elicits a defensive response by the nurse. Asking the nurse whether she will assess and document pain for every patient invites a negative response and does not use an assertive approach. Asking the nurse to explain why she has not been assessing and documenting pain is also judgmental."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "When the nurse states, “I’m leaving for the day. Is there anything I can do for you before I leave?” the nurse-patient relationship is entering the termination phase. The termination phase is the conclusion of the relationship, which can occur at the end of a nurse’s shift. The pre-interaction phase occurs before the nurse meets the patient. The statement “I’ll be admitting you to our floor as soon as I obtain your history” demonstrates the pre-interaction phase of the nurse-patient relationship. The nurse introduces herself to the patient during the orientation phase. During the working phase of the nurse-patient relationship, feelings are explored. This phase is demonstrated by the statement, “You seem upset today. Would you like to talk about whatever is bothering you?”"

        "Explanation": "The organized group is a short-term group. Short-term groups focus on the task at hand, which in this case is evaluating infusion pumps.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Because patients are typically confused by medical terminology, the nurse should use language that the patient can understand. “NG tube,” “Gomco,” “suction secretions,” “nares,” and “emesis” are all medical jargon that the patient might not understand. Moreover, the nurse should explain all procedures before performing them to help minimize the patient’s anxiety. “Lie still, please . . . ” offers no explanation of why the NG tube is being inserted, and it conveys that the nurse is impatient."

        "Choice 1": "Administer pain medication to the patient.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The nurse should assess the patient to determine whether he is having pain. The nurse should not assume by the patient’s nonverbal communication that the patient is in pain and administer pain medication; the nurse should validate the message being sent. The nurse should not turn and reposition the patient without assessing him. Leaving the patient without addressing his nonverbal cues is neglectful."

        "Choice 4": "Speak in English, but speak very slowly.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The nurse should request the services of a hospital translator to communicate with the patient who does not speak English. A family member should not be used as a translator unless there are no other options because it is often culturally unacceptable to have a family member ask personal questions. Also, considering the patient’s right to confidentiality, it is not appropriate to share private information about the patient with family members unless permission is obtained. Using sign language can be an effective strategy for hearing-impaired persons. Speaking slowly in English is not useful if the patient does not understand the language."

Responses such as, “If I were you, I’d go with chemotherapy” and “Why don’t you see what your wife thinks” do not respect the patient’s right to make his own decisions. “What do you think about radiation therapy,” is leading the patient without exploring the other options."

        "Choice 2": "Maintaining a distance of 6 to 12 inches",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Sitting down to speak with the patient enhances communication because it communicates a willingness to listen. A concerned expression, not a neutral one, demonstrates interest and attention. Maintaining a distance of 18 inches to 4 feet, not 6 to 12 inches, while speaking allows most patients to feel comfortable, thereby enhancing communication. When the interpersonal distance is too close, patients might feel uncomfortable. Asking open-ended questions is a verbal communication strategy, not a nonverbal behavior."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The nurse can gather more information about the patient’s reasons for stopping his blood pressure medication by asking him to tell her more about his experience with the medication. Telling the patient he is lucky he did not have a stroke suggests criticism. Asking the patient why he stopped taking his high blood pressure medication may cause the patient to become defensive and halt further communication. Telling the patient that it is very important to take his blood pressure medication is patronizing and also suggests criticism; at the very least, it fails to elicit more communication from the patient."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The nurse can intervene best by sitting quietly with the patient’s wife, allowing her to compose her thoughts. Silence communicates acceptance. After processing the bad news, the wife can provide the nurse with further information, such as whether she would like to consult with a chaplain.

        "Explanation": "Restating the patient’s concern by saying, “Breast cancer is a serious disease; I can understand why you’re worried” conveys concern and active listening. Stating that there have been many advances in breast cancer treatment minimizes the patient’s concern. Stating that the patient is young and should have no trouble surviving breast cancer minimizes the patient’s concern and offers false reassurance.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The statement pertaining to helping to gather information about of the cost of materials is an assertive response. It does not threaten the authority of the nurse manager and introduce another element preventing change that is unrelated to the procedure itself. It states the nurse’s position and wishes clearly with an “I” statement, and it does not invite negative responses. The statement beginning with “This is a widely used practice” is aggressive and implies criticism and a judgment that the nurse manager does not read as much as she should. The statement ending with “I wouldn’t want to create chaos” is passive and submissive. The statement beginning with “Is the budget more important . . .” is aggressive and judgmental."

        "Explanation": "The nurse demonstrates active listening by facing the patient, making eye contact, and listening while he expresses concerns. Arranging time to sit with the patient and his wife to discuss fears about an upcoming surgery also indicates active listening. Listening to the patient while performing activities, such as hanging an IV infusion or bathing him, distracts the nurse from active listening. Although taking detailed notes can help the nurse to accurately recall the patient’s words, this activity while listening to the patient speak can also be a distraction and could reduce eye contact and nonverbal cues of care and concern."

Although it is important information, the question “Is your pain severe?” prompts a “yes” or “no” response. “When did you first notice this pain?”—also important information—is likely to stimulate a brief, factual answer.

        "Explanation": "The nurse should ask the mother to remove the infant’s clothing and diaper before weighing and measuring the infant. An older child can be examined in his underwear; infants should be undressed. Infants are typically more comfortable with the parent close by, so the mother should remain in the room. The infant should be supine with knees extended on the examination table when being measured, not when being weighed."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The best response by the nurse is to explain that Mongolian spots are common in dark-skinned newborns and typically fade over time. The nurse should report the finding in the patient health record, but there is no need to notify the physician immediately. It is inappropriate for the nurse to recommend that the mother take her newborn to a plastic surgeon; Mongolian spots do not require treatment.

        "Explanation": "A small pulsation at the fifth intercostal space midclavicular line is known as the point of maximal impulse (PMI) and is considered a normal finding. A thrill is a vibration or pulsation palpated in any area except the PMI. A murmur occurs when structural defects in the heart’s chambers or valves cause turbulent blood flow. A heave, which is a visible palpation, is associated with an enlarged ventricle."

However, assessment over time is important to be sure the gait and positioning develop normally. The nurse should allay the father’s concerns by providing him with this information. The child shows no signs, in the scenario above, that physical therapy is needed. It is not appropriate for the nurse to recommend an orthopedic surgeon; physician referrals are given by the physician or advanced practice nurse when appropriate. “Your child is walking fine . . .” is condescending and does not appropriately address the father’s concerns."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Because older adults may tire easily and because they may have stiff muscles and arthritic joints, the nurse should arrange the sequence of the exam to limit position changes. The nurse should work efficiently; however, speed is not the goal, and the nurse should observe the patient’s energy level and stop for periods of rest as needed. It is appropriate to demonstrate equipment for school-age children but is not usually necessary for older adults, who have probably experienced other physical examinations. Because this is a comprehensive exam, it is not appropriate to omit portions of the exam because they may be tiring. As discussed, the patient should rest and then the nurse should return to the examination."

        "Explanation": "Thrush in this patient is an example of an endogenous nosocomial infection. This type of infection arises from suppression of the patient’s normal floras as a result of some form of treatment, such as antibiotics. Normal floras usually keep yeast from growing in the mouth. In exogenous nosocomial infection, the pathogen arises from the healthcare environment. A latent infection causes no symptoms for long periods.

        "Explanation": "The stage of decline occurs when the patient’s immune defenses, along with any medical therapies (in this case antibiotics), are successfully reducing the number of pathogenic microbes. As a result, the signs and symptoms of infection begin to fade. Incubation is the stage between the invasion by the organism and the onset of symptoms. During the incubation stage, the patient does not know he is infected and is capable of infecting others. The prodromal stage is characterized by the first appearance of vague symptoms. Convalescence is characterized by tissue repair and a return to healing as the organisms disappear."

Passive immunity occurs when antibodies are transferred from an immune host, such as from a placenta to a fetus. Passive immunity is short lived. Active immunity is longer lived and comes from the host. Humoral immunity occurs by secreted antibodies binding to antigens. Cell-mediated immunity does not involve antibodies but rather is a fight of infection from macrophages that kill pathogens."

Acetaminophen and a tepid bath are not necessary for this low-grade fever because fever is beneficial in fighting infection. Adequate rest, not necessarily bedrest, is necessary with a fever."

        "Explanation": "Standard precautions should be instituted with all clients whenever there is a possibility of coming in contact with blood, body fluids (except sweat), excretions, secretions, mucous membranes, and breaks in the skin (e.g., while inserting a peripheral IV). When interviewing a client, if the disease is not spread by air or droplets, there is no likelihood of the nurse’s encountering body fluids. If the disease is spread by air or droplets, then droplet or airborne precautions would be needed in addition to standard precautions. If giving a complete bed bath or performing oral hygiene, the nurse would need to use standard precautions (gloves); if merely assisting a client to perform those ADLs, it is not necessary. No exposure to body fluids is likely when helping a client to ambulate after surgery."

If the patient reports a single fall, the nurse should do the Get Up and Go Test. If the patient has difficulty with that test, or is unsteady with it, the nurse should perform a follow-up assessment of gait and balance by having the person close the eyes for a few seconds wile standing in place; stand with eyes closed while the nurse pushes gently on the sternum; walk, stop, turn around, return to the chair, and sit in the chair without using his arms for support.

        "Explanation": "The nurse should use one-to-one supervision with this patient to maintain the patient’s safety. One way to accomplish this is by encouraging a family member to stay with the patient. Restraints should be used only when all other less-restrictive measures have failed and are absolutely necessary to prevent injury to the patient. Restraints have been shown to jeopardize patient safety. It is not appropriate to administer sedation for the purpose of keeping the patient in bed; this is a form of restraint. Keeping the side rails up is also a form of restraint and increases the risk for falling."

After giving the water, call the poison control center. The American Academy of Pediatrics does not advise giving syrup of ipecac. Emergency departments have stopped using ipecac in favor of activated charcoal, which binds to poison in the stomach and prevents it from entering the bloodstream. Continued vomiting caused by syrup of ipecac may later result in the child being unable to tolerate activated charcoal or other poison treatments. No one can tell how much a child vomits, and therefore, no one would know if all the poison was eliminated from the stomach. There is also potential for misuse by bulimics.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "If the nurse suspects aspiration in a child who is coughing vigorously, the nurse should encourage the child to continue coughing. If coughing weakens, the nurse should perform the choking maneuver by administering five rapid back blows alternated with five upward thrusts to the upper abdomen with a fisted hand, just below the rib cage. A blind finger sweep should never be performed because it could push the foreign object into the airway."

A reduction in healthcare errors could indirectly reduce healthcare costs, but this is not the intent of the campaign. The campaign has nothing to do with automobile accidents, as might be deduced from the fact that the Joint Commission and Medicare/Medicaid regulate healthcare agencies. The campaign has little relationship to insurance, other than to encourage clients to speak up, ask questions, and know their rights."

        "Explanation": "The nurse should keep the door open and position herself so that the patient cannot block her exit from the room (stay between the patient and the door). The nurse should not enter a room alone with an angry patient. The progression to physical violence is first anxiety, then verbal aggression, and finally physical aggression. The nurse’s first priority in this situation is her own safety and the safety of others in the environment. The object is to relieve the patient’s anxiety and not respond to anger with anger. Questioning about weapons, or being firm and defending against verbal aggression will likely provoke even more anger from the patient. The nurse must be calm and reassuring."

        "Explanation": "The nurse should instruct the patient prescribed an anticoagulant to use an electric razor instead of a double-edge razor for shaving to prevent the risk of excess bleeding. Older adults should be encouraged to use skin moisturizers and use less soap while bathing to combat excess drying of the skin that occurs as a result of aging.

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The nurse should provide care in small intervals to avoid overstimulating the patient, thereby causing a rise in his intracranial pressure. It is not necessary to avoid bathing the patient. Using cool water to bathe the patient may cause shivering, which may elevate intracranial pressure and increase metabolic demands. Rubbing briskly when drying might also overstimulate, leading to an elevation in intracranial pressure."

        "Explanation": "The nursing diagnosis Bathing/Hygiene Self-care Deficit is most appropriate for addressing the patient’s inability to get in and out of the bathtub independently. There are no data to suggest that the patient is completely unable to care for himself; therefore, Total Self-care Deficit is not appropriate.

        "Explanation": "The nurse should offer a back massage during hour of sleep (HS) care to promote relaxation. During afternoon care the nurse should prepare the patient to receive visitors or for afternoon rest. Early morning care is provided after the patient awakens. It commonly prepares the patient for breakfast or procedures, such as diagnostic testing. Early morning care typically consists of assisting with toileting, face and hand washing, and mouth care. Morning care occurs after breakfast and commonly consists of toileting, bathing, and mouth, skin, and hair care. It may also include dressing and positioning or assisting the patient to the chair."

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Morning care for the patient who underwent surgical repair of a bowel 2 days ago can be safely delegated to the nursing assistive personnel because the patient should be stable. The patient who sustained a closed head injury may develop increased intracranial pressure during care. Therefore, he requires the critical thinking skills of a registered nurse to perform his morning care safely. The patient admitted with septic shock may easily become unstable with care; therefore, a registered nurse is required to provide his morning care safely.

        "Explanation": "The epidermis contains melanin, a pigment that protects against the sun’s ultraviolet rays; therefore, a person with insufficient melanin is at Risk For Impaired Skin Integrity (sunburn). There are no symptoms to indicate that the client has a sunburn (actual Impaired Skin Integrity), only that a risk factor is present. The dermis contains blood and lymphatic vessels, nerves, bases of hair follicles, and sebaceous and sweat glands; melanin does not prevent fluid loss. Fibroblasts (not melanin), also found in the dermis, produce new cells and assist in wound healing, thereby helping to prevent infection."

        "Explanation": "Excoriation is a loss of the superficial layers of the skin caused by the digestive enzymes in feces. Maceration is the softening of skin from exposure to moisture. Abrasion, a rubbing away of the epidermal layer of the skin, especially over bony areas, is often caused by friction or searing forces that occur when a patient moves in bed.

        "Explanation": "Nurses need to individualize bathing to meet the needs of the patient. If the patient becomes belligerent, the nurse should wait until the patient calms down and then attempt a towel bath. Towel baths have been shown to reduce agitation significantly. The patient should not be forced into the tub.

        "Explanation": "The nurse should have the patient lie down so that if the eye is dropped when removing it, it will fall onto the bed instead of the floor. Sitting back in the chair would allow access to the eye but would not protect the artificial eye from falling to the floor. Leaning forward and resting the arms on an overbed table, as well as standing up and leaning over the bed, would not provide the nurse access to the eye to remove the prosthesis."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Therapeutic range is a range whereby the medication is at a concentration to produce the desired effect. This patient’s level is within the therapeutic range, so the nurse should administer the next dose as prescribed. The dose should not be increased or decreased because the prescribed dose is producing a level within the therapeutic range.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Trough levels are typically obtained approximately 30 minutes before administering the next dose of the drug. Therefore, the trough cannot be collected with the morning routine laboratory studies. The vancomycin peak should be obtained 2 hours after the next dose infuses. Peak level must be measured when absorption is complete. This depends on all the factors that affect absorption. Trough levels would be inaccurate if the specimen is obtained while the drug infuses."

Therefore, pain management must be carefully planned to promote patient comfort. Drug abuse is the inappropriate intake of a substance continually or periodically. Drug misuse is the nonspecific, indiscriminate, or improper use of drugs, including alcohol, over-the-counter preparations, and prescription drugs. Drug dependence occurs when a person relies on or needs a drug. Dependence leads to lifestyle changes that focus around obtaining and administering the drug."

        "Explanation": "The best phrasing for the expected outcome is the one with a specific, measurable time frame (1 week) and details for how to resolve the patient’s knowledge deficit. The other options provide no timeline for achieving the goal and are therefore not measurable. Expected outcome statements must be measurable."

        "Question": "When the nurse enters a patient’s room to administer a medication, he calls out from the bathroom telling her to leave his medication on the bedside table. He reassures her that he will take the medication as soon as he is finished. How should the nurse proceed?",
        "Choice 1": "Inform the patient that she will return when he is finished in the bathroom.",

        "Explanation": "The nurse should inform the patient that she will return with the medication when he is finished in the bathroom. The nurse likely would not have time to stand outside the door and wait for the patient to finish in the bathroom. If the medication is left at the bedside for the patient, the nurse cannot be sure that the patient actually took the medication. Withholding the dose until the next administration time may compromise the patient’s condition and is not appropriate nursing action. The drug should not be omitted; therefore, the nurse should not document a missed dose in the medication administration record."

        "Choice 1": "Request that the prescriber change the order to the IV route.",
        "Choice 2": "Administer the medication by the IM route.",
        "Choice 3": "Use a needleless syringe to place the medication in the side of the mouth.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "When a patient has difficulty taking liquid medications from a cup, the nurse should use a syringe without a needle to place the medication in the side of the patient’s mouth. After placing the syringe between the gum and cheek, the nurse should push the plunger to administer the medication slowly. It is not necessary to ask the prescriber to change the order to the IV route; it is preferable to use the least invasive route. The nurse cannot administer a drug by another route without a prescription to do so. Dosing might not necessarily be the same between oral and IM routes; thus, a prescription is needed to change the route. Some drugs are not compatible with various food or liquid substances and should be taken on an empty stomach. Consult a pharmacist, prescriber, or drug formulary."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "To avoid needlestick injuries, the nurse should place the uncapped needle, pointing downward, directly into a specially marked, puncture-proof container. Recapping the needle should only be done when no other feasible alternative is available. When recapping is necessary, use an acceptable technique such as the one-handed scoop technique in which the nurse places the needle cap on a sterile surface and, using one hand, scoops up the cap with the needle. Placing the needle in an improper container (biohazard bag) that could be punctured by the contaminated needle places other staff members at risk."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The preferred site for IM injections for infants who are not yet walking is the vastus lateralis muscle because there are no major blood vessels or nerves in the area and the gluteal muscles have not been developed by walking.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "To relax the vastus lateralis for injection, the nurse should have the patient assume a sitting position or lie flat with his knee slightly flexed. Applying a warm compress, massaging the site, and applying soothing lotion are inappropriate interventions before administering an IM injection. After injection, massaging the site can enhance the absorption of medication into the muscle. Applying a warm compress increases circulation to the site, which can also enhance absorption. This action would be performed after the injection and not before."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "When a medication error is made, the nurse should first check the patient to assess for negative effects. If she is unfamiliar with the side effects of the medication, she should consult a drug reference, the licensed pharmacist at the institution, or the prescriber. Next she should verify that she made an error and identify the type. Notify the nurse in charge and the physician. Follow any orders the physician prescribes. Document the drug, the dose, site, route, date, and time in the patient’s healthcare record but do not document that the drug was given in error.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The parent can give the child a frozen fruit bar or frozen flavored ice pop just before the medication. This helps to numb the taste buds to weaken the taste of the medication.\r\nTo mask bad-tasting medicines, parents can crush pills or empty the contents of a capsule as long as it is not a time-release dose, and mix with soft foods, such as applesauce, hot cereal, or pudding. This is helpful for patients who might aspirate liquids, as well.\r\nIf the child is old enough to understand, warn him when a medication has an objectionable taste. Otherwise, his trust might be compromised if he is surprised with a bad taste.\r\nDo not use essential foods in the child’s diet (e.g., milk or orange juice) to mask the taste of medications. The child may later refuse a food that he associates with the medicine."

        "Explanation": "A patient newly diagnosed with hypertension may not be motivated to learn because he most likely has not experienced physical symptoms or other outward complications. Therefore, the nurse should motivate the patient by pointing out serious risks to the quality of life if the blood pressure control is not achieved. Although readiness to learn is an important consideration, treatment might be delayed too long if the patient does not appropriately perceive the immediacy of the health risk. Simply encouraging a patient to learn about blood pressure and treatment options might not be suitable motivation to engage in active learning and to comply with prescribed treatment. Reassuring the patient and promising a good outcome by complying with medical treatment is not appropriate.

If instructions are written at too high a reading level, the patient may not understand and make a harmful error in dosing. Calling the provider when objects look yellow or green is the clearest statement for patient teaching because the instruction is short, concrete, and written with easy-to-understand words.

From a practical point of view, a lecture format (traditional classroom or webinar) is efficient and effective with large groups. Although printed materials can help to reinforce information taught during a lecture, this can be problematic for auditory learners or those whose primary spoken language is not English.

        "Question": "During advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) training, a nurse performs defibrillation using a mannequin. Which teaching strategy is being employed?",
        "Choice 1": "One-to-one instruction",
        "Choice 2": "Computer-assisted instruction",
        "Choice 3": "Role modeling",
        "Choice 4": "Simulation",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "ACLS training utilizes this strategy by creating a scenario using resuscitation mannequins and teaching healthcare workers to respond appropriately to life-threatening cardiopulmonary events. The nurse is demonstrating the skill of defibrillation. ACLS certification requires learners to perform the skill back to the examiner. With one-to-one instruction, one instructor orally presents information to one student. With ACLS training, the healthcare team is involved and not just individual nurses. In role modeling, the teacher teaches by example, demonstrating the behaviors (not skills) that need to be acquired by learners."

        "Question": "During family therapy, to improve communication skills the nurse teaches family members to rehearse responses to situations involving interpersonal conflict. What is the primary drawback of using this teaching strategy?",
        "Choice 1": "Some people might have difficulty with an interactive approach when there is conflict among participants.",
        "Choice 2": "Nurses might rehearse responses that are not effective for resolving interpersonal conflict.",
        "Choice 3": "Nurses do not use the rehearsal technique because it is an inefficient use of time for participants.",
        "Choice 4": "This type of interactive teaching strategy is not as effective as dispersing information verbally or in print.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The teaching strategy described is role-playing. Role-playing may cause participants to feel self-conscious; to be effective, participants must be willing to participate as an observer or role player, particularly in a situation where there is conflict among those involved in the exercise. With role-playing, the participant may be unaware that teaching is occurring. The strategy can therefore be a productive use of time while modeling effective responses and desired behavior. Rehearsing real-life situations common to family dynamics is typically more effective for conflict resolution than reading about the topic or discussing approaches for effective communication."

        "Question": "An older adult patient who underwent bowel resection is recovering from surgery without complication. He ambulates in the hallway and requires little analgesia for pain. During the healthcare team’s morning rounds, the surgeon informs the patient that the lesion removed was cancerous. Which factor will likely be the patient’s most significant obstacle for learning?",
        "Choice 1": "The patient’s baseline physical condition",
        "Choice 2": "A negative environmental influence",
        "Choice 3": "Anxiety associated with the new diagnosis",
        "Choice 4": "Reduced ability to understand the diagnosis",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Anxiety associated with the new diagnosis of cancer will most likely be a barrier to learning in this patient. Fear of the unknown, fear of pain, fear of physical discomfort with treatment options, fear of altered role in home or work life, and many other fears accompany the anxiety patients often experience when potentially life-threatening diagnoses are communicated. The patient has been ambulating and requiring minimal amount of pain medication; therefore, his physical condition is probably not the most significant barrier to learning. Simply because the patient is an older adult does not suggest he has reduced capacity to learn."

        "Question": "How can the nurse best provide teaching for a patient whose primary spoken language is not the same as hers?",
        "Choice 1": "Provide written materials in the patient’s primary language.",
        "Choice 2": "Make arrangements to teach using an interpreter.",
        "Choice 3": "Provide a demonstration and request a return demonstration.",
        "Choice 4": "Use visual teaching aids to convey information.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The nurse can best provide teaching for the patient whose primary spoken language is not the same as her own by requesting the aid of an interpreter. An interpreter can help the nurse to communicate clearly and accurately when assessing learning needs; dispersing the information; providing feedback to learners; and determining if teaching is effective. An interpreter also allows the patient to ask questions when necessary and the healthcare provider to respond with meaningful information. Written materials in the patient’s primary language can help reinforce teaching. Demonstrating and requesting a return demonstration may be difficult if the patient does not understand the spoken language of the nurse. Visual aids may also be helpful for some learners, but they should not be the primary method for teaching because they do not offer an opportunity for the exchange of information through questions, demonstration, or discussion."

        "Choice 1": "Show the child a short, animated video (DVD) about the hospital visit and procedure.",
        "Choice 2": "Give the child a tour of the hospital a week before the surgery is scheduled.",
        "Choice 3": "Allow the child to use computer-assisted instruction to teach him about the procedure.",
        "Choice 4": "Provide one-to-one instruction about the care he will need after surgery.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "To reduce anxiety in a preschool-age child requiring surgery, show a short, animated video showing the area of the hospital where the child will be. The video should include a simple explanation of what is going to happen while he is in the hospital and afterward in a manner that is upbeat and friendly. A tour of the hospital with the sights and smells of sicker people might be more frightening to the young child. It is best to avoid exposure to pathogens before surgery, such as what could be acquired when touring the building. One-to-one instruction is a teaching strategy that is effective with adults and older children."

        "Choice 1": "Immediately",

        "Choice 4": "Four weeks before implementation",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "People retain information better when they have the opportunity to use it soon after it is presented. Therefore, the nurse manager should schedule teaching sessions 1 week before implementation of the equipment. If classes are scheduled too early, the nurses might forget how to use the equipment before it is implemented. If the teaching is offered immediately prior to use with patients, there would not be an adequate opportunity to practice skills and ask appropriate questions regarding use of the new device."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The young adult patient admitted with acute renal failure who needs hemodialysis will probably have Deficient Knowledge related to his treatment regimen. Patients with chronic illness, such as diabetes or cancer, are most likely to be knowledgeable about the disease and course of treatment; therefore, the nursing diagnosis Deficient Knowledge is less relevant than it is to a patient who is newly diagnosed. The adolescent patient with Down syndrome would have a nursing diagnosis of Impaired Ability to Learn."

        "Choice 1": "Encouraging the patient to check the blood sugar each time the nurse gives insulin",
        "Choice 2": "Providing feedback after the patient takes his blood sugar for the first time",
        "Choice 3": "Verbally instructing the patient about how to obtain a finger-stick blood sugar",
        "Choice 4": "Offering a brochure that describes the technique for checking blood sugar",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Having the patient check the finger-stick with the nurse each time insulin is administered is the best way to practice the correct technique and gain confidence prior to discharge. Repetition increases the likelihood that the patient will retain information and incorporate it into the daily management of his diabetes care. Although feedback is important, the patient might need it on more than one occasion. Verbal instructions for performing a new skill are most useful when the patient has an opportunity to perform the technique. A brochure is informative and useful for later reference; however, information about performing a new skill is best offered when the patient can see it demonstrated and has the opportunity to practice it with feedback from the nurse."

        "Choice 1": "Write down instructions so the patient can read them at home.",
        "Choice 2": "Discuss the information while assisting the patient with his bath.",
        "Choice 3": "Educate the patient about his medications as each one is given.",
        "Choice 4": "Follow up with the patient after discharge with a phone call.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Teaching does not have to be performed in a formal session but is often most effective at a teachable moment when the information is perceived as most relevant, such as at the time the medication is given to the patient. Additionally, the information is more memorable when the patient can see the actual dose and identify it with the information presented. A teaching session about wound care would be appropriate during bathing but not medication teaching. Providing the patient written instructions without discussing the information does not allow the patient an opportunity to ask questions or the nurse to verify the patient understands the instruction. The patient should not be discharged without education about his prescribed medications, including what they are for, how to take them, instructions regarding dosing, what side effects can occur, and when to stop taking the medications."

People who respond to direction from respected authorities often prefer a health promotion program that is supervised by a health provider. Clients who feel in charge of their own health are the easiest to motivate toward positive change."

        "Explanation": "Secondary prevention activities detect illness so that it can be treated in the early stages. Health activities such as mammograms, testicular examinations, regular physical examinations, blood pressure and diabetes screenings, and tuberculosis skin tests are examples of secondary interventions. Primary prevention activities are designed to prevent or slow the onset of disease and promote health. Activities such as eating healthy foods, exercising, wearing sunscreen, obeying seat-belt laws, and getting immunizations are examples of primary-level interventions. Tertiary prevention focuses on stopping the disease from progressing and returning the individual to the pre-illness phase."

She can give it to supplement any stored breast milk she might have in supply. She should emphasize the importance of giving the baby iron-fortified formula because fetal iron stores become depleted by 4 to 6 months of age. Infants younger than 1 year of age should not receive regular cow’s milk because it may place a strain on the immature kidneys. Because the baby weighs 14 pounds, he will require about 21 ounces of formula a day (not 36 ounces), based on the nutritional recommendations that infants require 80 to 100 mL of formula or breast milk per kilogram of body weight per day."

Vitamin A deficiency can be associated with night blindness in heavy drinkers; vitamin D deficiency leads to softening of the bones. Because some alcoholics are deficient in vitamins A, C, D, E, and K and the B vitamins, they experience delayed wound healing.

A PN of this type should not be discontinued abruptly, but rather over several (as many as 48) hours to prevent a sudden drop in blood sugar. Hypoglycemia is unlikely to occur with a 3:1 solution (containing lipids), as the final concentration of glucose is less than 10%.

        "Explanation": "Dehydration can occur as a result of continued nausea and vomiting, so the nurse should assess for it. However, this intervention does not prevent nausea. Dietary supplements might help to prevent malnutrition. However, they do not prevent nausea; in fact, they often cause nausea. Having the patient sit upright helps to prevent respiratory aspiration should the patient vomit; it does not prevent or relieve nausea. Odors (even pleasant ones) and even the sight of food can cause nausea, so any uneaten food should be removed immediately from the room."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The nurse should do nothing; this is normal. During the first few days of life, a term newborn passes green-black, tarry stools known as meconium. Stools transition to a yellow-green color over the next few days. After that, the appearance of stools depends upon the feedings the newborn receives. Sterile water does nothing to alter this progression. Meconium stools are more irritating to the buttocks than other stools because they are so sticky and the skin usually must be rubbed to cleanse it. However, meconium leads to skin breakdown like a watery stool does."

        "Explanation": "Although the patient may have diarrhea, the goal is not to stop the diarrhea, but to eliminate the pathogens from the digestive tract. The active bacteria in yogurt stimulate peristalsis and promote healing of intestinal infections. Pasta is a low-fiber food that slows peristalsis. It does not promote healing of intestinal infections. Oatmeal stimulates peristalsis, but it does not promote healing of intestinal infections.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Antibiotics such as cephalexin, given to combat infection, decrease the normal flora in the colon that cause diarrhea. Bacterial populations can be maintained by encouraging the patient to consume yogurt daily while taking the drugs. Diarrhea is a common adverse effect of antibiotics; stopping the drug is not necessary. The patient should not be encouraged to take an antidiarrheal agent at this time. Increasing the intake of fiber combats constipation, not diarrhea."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Patients who require bowel surgery typically remain NPO until peristalsis returns, helping to prevent paralytic ileus, a complication that can occur after the bowel is surgically manipulated. Administering morphine promotes comfort but may increase the risk of ileus. Administering IV fluids prevents dehydration but does not directly prevent ileus.

Limiting the intake of gas-forming foods is a good idea from a social perspective; however, it does not help achieve the goal of having regular bowel movements and thus, eliminating the need to wear a pouch.

        "Answer": "1, 2",
        "Explanation": "Physical activity stimulates peristalsis and bowel elimination. Therefore, those with a sedentary lifestyle commonly experience constipation. High-dose calcium therapy also predisposes a patient to constipation. Lactose intolerance and consuming spicy foods are associated with a nursing diagnosis of Diarrhea, not Constipation."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Glomerular filtration rate is the amount of filtrate formed by the kidneys in 1 minute. Renal blood flow progressively decreases with aging primarily because of reduced blood supply through the micro blood vessels of the kidney. A decrease in glomerular filtration is the most important functional deficit caused by aging. Urate crystals are somewhat common in the newborn period. They might indicate that the infant is dehydrated. In older people, they result from too much uric acid in the blood, although this is not related to aging. Renal mass (weight) decreases over time, starting around age 30 to 40."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Normal urine specific gravity ranges from 1.010 to 1.025. Specific gravity less than 1.010 indicates fluid volume excess, such as when the patient has fluid overload (too much IV fluid) or when the kidneys fail to concentrate urine. Specific gravity greater than 1.025 is a sign of deficient fluid volume that occurs, for example, as a result of blood loss or dehydration."

        "Choice 3": "MAO inhibitor",
        "Choice 4": "Anticholinergic",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "A loop diuretic [e.g., Furosemide (Lasix)] increases urine elimination. It works by limiting the reabsorption of water in the renal tubules and is used to reduce congestion in the cardiopulmonary circulation. A thiazide diuretic is used to treat high blood pressure by reducing the amount of sodium and water in the blood vessels. An MAO inhibitor [e.g., phenelzine (Nardil)] is an antidepressant that is used after other medications have proven unsuccessful in lifting symptoms of serious depression. Anticholinergics [e.g., ipratropium (Atrovent)] relax smooth muscle in the airways. Also known as antispasmodics, they reduce airway constriction experienced by those with asthma, for example.\r\nis a cholesterol-lowering drug. Although high cholesterol is a leading factor for heart disease, the medication is used to reduce cholesterol in the blood—not to promote diuresis to reduce the demand on the heart and backflow into the lungs."

        "Choice 4": "Renal calculi",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Urine contains ammonia, which may cause excoriation with prolonged contact with the skin. Bowel incontinence, not urinary incontinence, increases the patient’s risk for urinary tract infection. Immobility and high consumption of calcium-containing foods increase the risk for renal calculi."

        "Choice 1": "Do nothing; this is normal postoperative urine output.",
        "Choice 2": "Increase the infusion rate of the patient’s IV fluids.",
        "Choice 3": "Notify the provider about the patient’s oliguria.",
        "Choice 4": "Administer the patient’s routine diuretic dose early.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "50 mL in 2 hours is not normal output. The kidneys typically produce 60 mL of urine per hour. Therefore, the nurse should notify the provider when the patient shows diminished urine output (oliguria). Patients who undergo abdominal surgery commonly require increased infusions of IV fluid during the immediate postoperative period. The nurse cannot provide increased IV fluids without a provider’s order. The nurse should not administer any medications before the scheduled time without a prescription. The provider may hold the patient’s scheduled dose of diuretic if he determines that the patient is experiencing deficient fluid volume."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "First, the nurse should put on gloves and have the patient void directly into the bedpan. Next, she should pour the urine into a graduated container, place the measuring device on a flat surface, and read the amount at eye level. She should observe the urine for color, clarity, and odor.

        "Choice 4": "“I will collect my urine each time I urinate for the next 24 hours.”",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "To obtain a clean-catch urine specimen, the nurse should instruct the patient to cleanse the genital area from front to back and collect the specimen midstream. This follows the principle of going from “clean” to “dirty.” The nurse should have the ambulatory patient void into a “hat” (container for collecting the urine of an ambulatory patient) when monitoring urinary output, but not when obtaining a clean-catch urine specimen. A urinary catheter is required for a sterile urine specimen, not a clean-catch specimen. A 24-hour urine collection may be necessary to evaluate some disorders, but a clean-catch specimen is a one-time collection."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Stress incontinence is an involuntary loss of urine that occurs with increased intra-abdominal pressure. Activities that typically produce the symptom include sneezing, coughing, laughing, lifting, and exercise. Transient incontinence is a short-term incontinence that is expected to resolve spontaneously. It is typically caused by urinary tract infection or medications, such as diuretics. Overflow incontinence is the loss of urine when the bladder becomes distended; it is commonly associated with fecal impaction, enlarged prostate, and neurological conditions.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The most appropriate outcome for this patient is “the patient will perform urostomy self-care” by a specific date. The patient with an ileal conduit is unable to resume a “normal” urination pattern; urine, along with mucus, drains continuously from the stoma site, so the urine will not be clear.

        "Explanation": "The nurse should inform the patient that clean technique can be used after discharge. The patient should wash his hands before the procedure, then wash the reusable catheter in soap and water, and rinse and store it in a clean, dry place. It is not necessary for the patient to use a new catheter for each catheterization. The patient should use a straight catheter; therefore, a balloon is not inflated after insertion.

        "Question": "The nurse is teaching an older female patient how to manage urge incontinence at home. What is the first-line approach to reducing involuntary leakage of urine?",
        "Choice 1": "Insertion of a pessary",
        "Choice 2": "Intermittent self-catheterization",
        "Choice 3": "Bladder training",
        "Choice 4": "Anticholinergic medication",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The goal of bladder training is to enable the patient to hold increasingly greater volumes of urine in the bladder and to increase the interval between voiding. This involves patient teaching, scheduled voiding, and self-monitoring using a voiding diary. In addition to teaching the mechanisms of urination, teach distraction and relaxation strategies to help inhibit the urge to void. Other techniques include deep breathing and guided imagery.\r\nA pessary is an incontinence device that is inserted into the vagina to reduce organ prolapse or pressure on the bladder. Clean, intermittent self-catheterization is a good option for managing incontinence that is resistant to conservative measure, such as bladder training, Kegel exercises, lifestyle modification, and medication. Anticholinergic medication can be highly effective for improving urinary incontinence. However, more conservative measures, such as timed voiding and Kegel exercises, are recommended first."

        "Choice 1": "Use antiseptic wipes to cleanse the meatus prior to obtaining the sample.",
        "Choice 2": "Briefly disconnect the catheter from the drainage tube to obtain the sample.",
        "Choice 3": "Withdraw urine through the port using a needleless access device.",
        "Choice 4": "Obtain the urine specimen directly from the collection bag.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "To obtain a specimen from an indwelling catheter, insert the needleless access device with a 20- or 30-mL syringe into the specimen port, and aspirate to withdraw the amount of urine you need. Wiping the meatus with an antiseptic material helps to minimize contamination for a clean-catch voided specimen, not a sample collected from a closed system such as an indwelling catheter system. Never disconnect the catheter from the drainage tube to obtain a sample. Interrupting the system creates a portal of entry for pathogens, thereby increasing the risk of contamination. Do not take the specimen from the collection bag because that urine may be several hours old."

        "Choice 4": "Diabetes mellitus",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 3",
        "Explanation": "Having had frequent ear infections (otitis media) places a patient at risk for hearing loss because of scarring that may have occurred. Older adults experience a generalized decrease in the number of nerve conduction fibers and structural changes in the ear, which cause hearing loss. Chickenpox and diabetes mellitus do not place the patient at risk for hearing loss."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "3, 4",
        "Explanation": "Safety measures are a priority for unconscious clients. Keep the bed in low position when you are not at the bedside, and keep the side rails up. If the patient’s blink reflex is absent or her eyes do not close totally, you may need to give frequent eye care to keep secretions from collecting along the lid margins. The eyes may be patched to prevent corneal drying, and lubricating eye drops may be ordered. It is important to talk to the patient because the sense of hearing may still be intact. This provides some stimulation and may help with reality orientation. Providing touch will also help prevent sensory deficit; however, it is not a safety measure."

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The nurse should document this finding as phantom pain. Phantom pain is pain that is perceived to originate in an area that has been amputated. Psychogenic pain refers to pain experienced by a person which does not match the symptoms or the apparent source of pain. It is thought to arise from psychological factors and is disproportional to the painful stimuli. Referred pain occurs in an area distant from the original site. Radiating pain starts at the source but extends to other locations."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Tissue damage causes the release of the substances histamine, bradykinin, and prostaglandin.

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Peripheral nerves carry the pain message to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord during a process known as transmission. In a process called transduction, specialized nociceptors convert potentially damaging mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli into electrical activity that leads to the experience of pain. Perception involves the recognition of pain by the frontal cortex of the brain. During modulation, pain signals can be facilitated or inhibited, and the perception of pain can be changed."

        "Explanation": "Music therapy can prompt the release of endogenous opioids during the modulation stage, which is the stage of the pain process where the perception of pain changes. It is not during the perception (recognizing the pain sensation), transmission (relaying the pain message), or transduction (converting potentially damaging stimuli into electrical activity leading to pain sensation)."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Pain associated with rib fractures causes splinting. Splinting often causes the patient to breathe shallowly and avoid deep coughing to expel sputum, which can lead to pneumonia. Rib fractures can also lead to complications such as pneumothorax and hemothorax; however, they do not result from inadequate pain control. Respiratory acidosis, not metabolic alkalosis, may result from the shallow breaths caused by pain and restricted chest wall movement with splinting."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The nurse should assess pain whenever a full set of vital signs is checked. Moreover, the nurse should assess pain on admission of a patient to the facility, even when pain is not the chief complaint. Patients may have chronic pain that has no association with their reason for seeking care. Pain should be assessed more frequently than every 4 hours in the immediate postoperative period. Pain should be reassessed after any treatment is given to evaluate effectiveness of the treatment. Some patients may not complain of pain unless they are specifically asked whether they are in pain. Pain rating scales help to quantify the intensity of pain for the nurse providing analgesia."

        "Choice 4": "Chronic pain (abdominal) secondary to abdominal surgery",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The nurse should identify a diagnosis by specifying the location of the pain and any precipitating or etiological factors. This patient is experiencing acute abdominal pain that is related to his surgery for colon cancer; therefore, a nursing diagnosis that specifies the surgery is the most appropriate diagnosis for this patient. In addition, options listing chronic pain are incorrect because the pain is acute, not chronic."

        "Question": "Which drug might the primary care provider prescribe to help facilitate pain management in a client with chronic pain?",
        "Choice 1": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor",
        "Choice 2": "Selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor",
        "Choice 3": "Narcotic analgesic",
        "Choice 4": "Anti-emetic",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The control of depression greatly facilitates pain management, especially for patients experiencing chronic pain. Therefore, the physician may prescribe a selective serotonin uptake inhibitor (antidepressant), such as paroxetine (Paxil), as part of the treatment plan. Selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, such as Atomoxetine (Strattera), are commonly used for attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder. If a narcotic, such as oxycodone (OxyContin), is used for a long time, it may become habit forming (causing mental or physical dependence). Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects when you stop taking the medicine. This is not the first-line therapy for chronic pain. An anti-emetic, such as ondansetron (Zofran), is used to control for nausea and vomiting, which can occur with some analgesic medication. However, the prescriber would more likely change the medication to something the patient tolerates better rather than order an anti-emetic to control the side effect."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The nurse should notify the prescriber that the current pain management plan is ineffective. The nurse should not delay treatment for 3 hours when the next dose of medication is due. The nurse cannot administer an extra dose of ibuprofen without a prescriber’s order to do so. Ibuprofen 800 mg is a maximum dose for most individuals. The nurse should not assume that the patient is not in pain simply because he appears comfortable; pain is what the patient states it is."

        "Explanation": "Music is a form of distraction that has been shown to reduce pain and anxiety by allowing the patient to focus on something other than pain. Guided imagery uses auditory and imaginary processes to help the patient to relax. In sequential muscle relaxation, the patient sits and tenses muscles for 15 seconds and then relaxes the muscles while breathing out.

        "Explanation": "Therapeutic touch focuses on the use of hands to direct energy fields surrounding the body. The nurse should document use of therapeutic touch and its effectiveness in the progress notes after performing the procedure. Tactile distraction involves activities such as massage, hugging a favorite toy, holding a loved one, or stroking a pet. Guided imagery uses auditory and imaginary processes to help the patient to relax. In sequential muscle relaxation, the patient sits and tenses muscles for 15 seconds and then relaxes the muscle while breathing out. This relaxation technique is often effective for relieving pain."

        "Choice 4": "Take the medication before bedtime.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The nurse should instruct the patient to take the medication with food to lessen gastric irritation. Taking the medication with 8 ounces of water will not decrease gastric irritation. Taking the medication just before bedtime may cause gastric reflux, increasing gastric irritation. Although indigestion is an unwanted side effect of naproxen, it is not an emergency that requires the prescriber to be notified immediately. However, prior to giving naproxen, be sure the patient has not had ulcers, stomach bleeding, or severe kidney or liver problems. If so, the patient is not a candidate for treatment with naproxen."

        "Explanation": "The nurse should assess the patient’s respiratory status and level of alertness before administering the medication because respiratory depression can be a life-threatening effect. It is not necessary to auscultate heart sounds or to check blood pressure while the patient lies down (supine position) and sits up. Psychological dependence occurs rarely even after long-term prescribed use of morphine.

        "Explanation": "Even in recommended doses, acetaminophen can cause hepatotoxicity in those who consume alcohol. Therefore, the nurse should caution the patient against combining acetaminophen with alcohol. Aspirin, not acetaminophen, increases the risk for bleeding because it inhibits platelet aggregation.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "A low pain rating is the best expected outcome for the patient with a nursing diagnosis of Acute Pain secondary to surgical resection of a ruptured spleen and possible inadequate analgesia because it is specific and measurable. The patient verbalizing reduced pain is not specific enough. The nurse needs to know how much pain relief is achieved. A numeric score gives a clearer indication of the effectiveness of analgesia. The patient might have experienced a reduction in pain, but his pain level might still be intolerable. Saying the patient’s pain is relieved because he is resting quietly does not address the pain relief while he is awake. Some patients will sleep in an attempt to cope with pain, so this outcome could lead to inaccurate evaluation. Providing pain medication is a nursing intervention, not an expected outcome."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The patient underwent surgery 5 days ago; if there are no complications, it is unlikely that he would require frequent dosing of analgesic. The nurse should recognize this behavior as a possible indicator of current substance abuse or addiction. Requesting oral pain medications every 6 to 8 hours is a typical behavior for a patient 5 days after surgery. Requesting an oral form of the drug does not indicate substance abuse."

        "Choice 4": "Sympathectomy",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Sympathectomy severs the pathways to the sympathetic nervous system. The procedure improves vascular blood supply and eliminates vasospasm. It is effective for treatment of pain associated with vascular disorders, such as Raynaud’s disease. Cordotomy interrupts pain and temperature sensation below the tract that is severed. This procedure is commonly performed to relieve trunk and leg pain. Rhizotomy interrupts the anterior or posterior nerve route located between the ganglion and the cord. It is commonly used to treat head and neck pain. Neurectomy is used to eliminate intractable localized pain. The pathways of peripheral or cranial nerves are interrupted to block pain transmission."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "If the patient’s score on the sedation rating scale is equal to or greater than 4, the nurse should first stimulate the patient. He should next notify the physician. The nurse should consider administering naloxone, as prescribed, if the patient’s respiratory rate is less than 8 breaths/minute; if respirations are shallow with marginal or falling oxygen saturation; or if the patient is unresponsive to stimulation. Before the patient receives another dose of pain medication, the dose should most likely be reduced and other potential causes of sedation should be investigated."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Patients who undergo mitral valve replacement typically require long-term anticoagulant therapy. Anticoagulant therapy is a contraindication for epidural analgesia use because of the risk for spinal hematoma and uncontrolled bleeding. Diabetes and hypertension are not contraindications for epidural analgesia. Epidural analgesia is commonly used after embolectomy because certain anesthetic agents, such as bupivacaine, help prevent vasospasm."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Treatment for a headache that occurs as a result of dural puncture consists of bedrest, analgesics as prescribed, and liberal hydration. Caffeine and a dark, quiet environment may also be helpful. Headaches will be more severe when the patient is sitting upright or ambulating. Fluid volume deficit will also aggravate a “spinal headache” after epidural anesthesia."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "There is no evidence to suggest that patients with dementia and other forms of cognitive impairment do not experience pain. It is most likely that they cannot effectively communicate the intensity or quality of pain and are therefore at risk for underassessment of pain and inadequate pain relief. Be aware of behavioral cues indicating pain rather than relying on verbal report. Failure to request pain medication is not likely a result of hesitation to ask for it out of habit or reliance on others; rather, it is likely due to inability to effectively express to the caregiver that analgesia is needed."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The patient’s self-report is the most reliable indicator of pain. A patient’s facial expression, vocalization, posture or position, or other behaviors do not always accurately indicate the intensity or quality of a patient’s experience of pain. The patient might be trying to hide signs of pain in order to be brave or strong. Sociocultural factors can influence a patient’s nonverbal expression of pain. Caregivers might not appreciate the extent of pain because pain is an individualized experience. Perception of pain might be heightened if other medical conditions coexist, although this perception is also influenced by other factors, such as past experience with pain and the success or failure of the treatment to produce relief. Emotions, cognitive impairment, developmental stage, communication skills, and mental health disorders, such as depression or anxiety, can influence the perception of pain."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 3",
        "Explanation": "The Wong-Baker face-rating scale uses simple illustrations of faces to depict various levels of pain. The scale was developed for children but has proved effective for adults with communication and cognitive impairments. The visual analog requires patients to point to a location on a line that reflects their pain level. Some patients have difficulty with the abstract nature of this scale. When using the numerical rating scale, the patient must choose a number from 0 to 10 to denote his pain level. This scale is sometimes difficult for clients with cognitive impairments, such as expressive aphasia; however, it would be appropriate to try it if the face-rating scale is not available.

        "Choice 1": "“You don’t need an x-ray; I can tell by the way your ankle looks and feels whether you have a strain or fracture.”",
        "Choice 2": "“Sprains, strains, and fractures have similar symptoms at first; you will need an x-ray of the joint to be certain.”",

Cardiac muscle contracts spontaneously and is blood ejected out of the heart. Slow-twitch fibers are a subtype of skeletal muscle cell. Slow-twitch fibers (type I), or “red” muscle, have a rich blood supply and are rich in mitochondria (the powerhouse of the cell) to give the muscle more oxygen and energy to sustain aerobic activity.

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "To assess for activity tolerance, assess and record vital signs before and after exercise. A rapid change from baseline vital signs or a slow return to baseline indicates limited activity tolerance. Anxiety might primarily exhibit signs of difficulty getting enough air and elevated heart rate and systolic blood pressure. Vitals would resolve when anxiety is reduced and not after exercise.

Upper body resistance training increases muscles strength and tone, which will aid him in using the walker more easily. Toning the lower body through exercise of the quadriceps and gluteal muscles, although important for regaining strength in general after surgery, does not aid in using a walker. Aerobic exercise with deep breathing produces the greatest benefit to cardiovascular health but does little to improve the upper body strength needed for ambulating with an assistive device."

        "Choice 1": "Impaired Mobility related to weakness",
        "Choice 2": "Ineffective Breathing Pattern related to disease process",

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The patient’s medical condition places him at an increased Risk for Injury: He is at risk for falls and for further injury to his hip. The patient does have Impaired Mobility; however, his Impaired Mobility puts him at Risk for Injury. A diagnosis of Impaired Mobility would focus the outcomes on improving his mobility rather than protecting him from further injury. We have no data other than a diagnosis of emphysema to indicate that he is experiencing Ineffective Breathing Pattern. He is experiencing Activity Intolerance, but this is not his primary safety risk. A diagnosis of Activity Intolerance would focus the goals on increasing his endurance and conserving his energy."

Increasing activity tolerance and mobility by the time of discharge is not specific and measurable. Additionally, these outcomes do not relate to Risk for Injury. A goal of effective breathing for a frail, elderly patient after hip surgery does not relate to Risk for Injury."

His parents tell the nurse, “Our son is just staring off into space; he won’t talk to us. We are worried because he has not even listened to his iPod, watched television, or played his video games for 2 days. That is so unlike him.” What is the best response the nurse can make?",
        "Choice 1": "“I will inform his doctor and see if we can get your son started on an antidepressant medication.”",
        "Choice 2": "“He is at a critical time in his life; teens are often moody, and being in the hospital with an injury will only make that worse.”",

        "Explanation": "Isometric exercise involves muscle contraction without motion. Isometric exercises are useful for developing strength. This type of exercise is appropriate for the patient who has had an extremity confined to a cast because muscle atrophy occurs when the muscle is not used.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Older adults should do exercises that maintain or improve balance if they are at risk of falling. Older adults should follow the adult guidelines, which are for 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity. Aerobic activity should be performed in periods of at least 10 minutes, preferably spread throughout the week. If this is not possible because of limiting chronic conditions, older adults should be as physically active as their abilities allow. They should avoid inactivity. Structured calisthenics programs are no more beneficial for achieving health benefits than other forms of moderate- and vigorous-intensity physical activity.

        "Explanation": "The person who lives in a skilled nursing facility might be sedentary because of advancing age and other age-associated medical problems that lead to inactivity. With obesity, movement becomes more difficult and strain on joints increases. A sedentary lifestyle, whether adult or child, contributes to obesity; activities, such as computer work and video games, are sedentary and require little physical activity.

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 2",
        "Explanation": "Lost fluids must be replaced to decrease the risk of dehydration, regardless of level of fitness. During intense exercise, the body can lose 2 liters of fluid for every hour of exercise. Elevated environmental temperatures also increase the amount of fluid lost through sweating. When athletes drink according to thirst, the risk that they will over-drink and so develop exercise-associated hyponatremia is minimized (Noakes, 2007). On the other hand, exercise can suppress thirst, making it an unreliable signal to replace fluids lost with exercise."

        "Explanation": "Proper body mechanics involves good body alignment, erect posture, and a wide base of support. To prevent back injury resulting from reaching and straining muscles, carry objects close to the trunk. Bending at the waist to lift objects uses the back muscles and increases the risk of injury.

The lifelong stresses associated with being transsexual penetrate nearly every aspect of life: medically, socially, and emotionally. Competent and responsive healthcare is essential, and nurses can be an especially valuable source of information and support during a time of isolation and emotional inner conflict. Reassuring the patient he is normal discounts his feelings and conveys insensitivity on the part of the nurse as well as a lack of willingness to listen openly. Genuine support and active listening are important for the transsexual person who is struggling with his gender identity. Interjecting your own experiences trivializes the patient’s experience. The nurse’s first action is to offer information rather than imply that the patient has a mental health issue requiring anti-anxiety agents."

Developing intimate relationships, fantasies and erotic dreams, masturbation, shared touching, oral–genital stimulation, anal stimulation or intercourse, sexual intercourse, and celibacy are all forms of sexual expression—even a lack of activity is an expression of sexuality."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "In many cultures, people have been socialized to avoid talking openly about sexuality. As a nurse, you will find that you must discuss a variety of issues that are vital for a client’s optimal wellness. Some of these discussions may include sexual concerns, dysfunctions, infections, or behaviors. As you reflect on the issues of human sexuality, you will be challenged to confront your own biases related to sexuality and to set those aside as you work with your clients. Although theoretical knowledge is important, you will be able to use it fully only if you can identify and set aside your own biases."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Many STIs have few or no symptoms. To find out if a patient has an STI, you must obtain a swab culture of secretions. For a man, a culture is obtained from the urethra. For a woman, secretions are swabbed near the cervix."

        "Choice 4": "“It isn’t unusual for him to fondle his genitals, as this is part of his exploration of his body.”",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "2, 3, 4",
        "Explanation": "The first two years of life are highly sensual as infants are nursed, stroked, bathed, and massaged, and they develop their first attachment experience through bonding with the mother. It is not unusual for infants and preschoolers to fondle their genitals and enjoy being nude. This is part of their exploration of their bodies, and parents should not overreact. Although health teaching about normal sexual development of toddlers is important, this mother’s comments are a red flag to appropriate discipline. Her exaggerated response using physical reprimands to a 2-year-old child bears further exploration about other potential for physical harm or abuse within the home. The nurse has a responsibility to assess risk to the child for an abusive situation and counsel the mother about alternate methods of dealing with the behavior."

Rape occurs when there is nonconsensual vaginal, anal, or oral penetration. It occurs through force, by the threat of bodily harm, or when the victim is incapable of giving consent.

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 4",
        "Explanation": "Use a calm, professional approach as you collect sexual data from your patients. This will not only help them to feel more comfortable and confident, but will also yield more honest and complete information. Your patient might have difficulty discussing the events relating to the assault; however, this is a private matter and not a topic to discuss with family members, regardless of the apparent closeness of the relationship. When asking personal questions, provide privacy and be sensitive to your client’s cues. A curtain is not secure enough because conversation easily could be overheard. Clear, unambiguous documentation is extremely important because of the criminal nature of sexual crime. Using the patient’s own words is a way for the nurse to avoid misinterpreting the facts as well as keep from introducing bias or drawing conclusions about the event."

        "Choice 1": "Benzodiazepines are eliminated from the body faster than are nonbenzodiazepines, so they do not provide a full night of sleep.",

        "Explanation": "A circadian rhythm is a biorhythm based on the day–night pattern in a 24-hour cycle. Sleep quality is best when the time at which the person goes to sleep and awakens is in synchrony with his circadian rhythm. Not all people require a quiet environment for sleep. Time spent in stage IV of the sleep cycle is affected by the total time spent asleep.

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The circadian rhythm is a biorhythm based on the day–night pattern in a 24-hour cycle. A person’s circadian rhythm is regulated by a cluster of cells in the hypothalamus of the brainstem that respond to changing levels of light. A major factor in regulating sleep is the amount of light received through the eyes—not the typical amount of sleep the person has within a 24-hour period. The autonomic nervous system (rather than central nervous system) controls the involuntary processes of the body, such as sleep, digestion, immune function, and so on."

        "Explanation": "During rest, the mind remains active and conscious; sleep is characterized by altered consciousness. Sleep is a cyclic state of decreased motor activity and perception. A sleeping person is unaware of the environment and does respond selectively to certain external stimuli.

        "Explanation": "Intense emotion before bedtime can interfere with rest and sleep. Lying awake longer than 30 minutes is counterproductive. Eating a small amount of a complex carbohydrate can aid in falling asleep. Avoid simple sugars because sucrose can lead to a short-term energy boost instead of relaxation. Taking naps during the day and sleeping late on some mornings can actually exacerbate a sleep disturbance. It’s better to establish a consistent routine for wake and sleep.

He may perform what appear to be conscious motor activities but does not wake up and has no memory of the event on awakening. The boy is at high risk for injury when sleepwalking because of his lack of awareness of his surroundings. Insomnia is a medical diagnosis rather than a nursing diagnosis. Certainly his sleep pattern is disturbed; however, there is little in the way of independent actions that the nurse could take for either the problem or etiology of this diagnosis, so it would not be useful. The boy does not awaken while sleepwalking and is not likely to experience fatigue from the event."

        "Explanation": "Sleepwalking places the patient at Risk for Injury because of his lack of awareness of the surroundings. The nurse’s primary intervention would be to protect the patient from injury (e.g., falls) while sleepwalking, also called somnambulation. Because the child is only 6 years old, administering and teaching about medications and having him verbalize feelings would not be useful.

        "Explanation": "Contrary to previous beliefs, stages III and IV of NREM (delta wave) are the deepest stages of sleep—not REM. It is difficult to awaken someone in stage IV slow wave NREM sleep, and if she is awakened, the person may appear confused and react slowly. Stage I NREM is a light sleep from which the sleeper can easily be awakened. Stage II (sleep spindles) is also light sleep; the sleeper in this stage is easily roused. REM sleep is the stage at which most dream activity occurs, as well as more spontaneous awakenings."

        "Explanation": "The stratum corneum is the outermost layer of the epidermis and is composed of numerous thicknesses of dead cells. Functioning as a barrier to the environment, it restricts water loss, prevents entry of fluids into the body, and protects the body against the entry of pathogens and chemicals. The subcutaneous layer is composed of adipose and connective tissue that provide insulation, protection, and an energy reserve (adipose). The dermis is composed of irregular fibrous connective tissue that provides strength and elasticity to the skin. The stratum germinativum is the innermost layer of the skin that produces new cells, pushing older cells toward the skin surface."

        "Choice 1": "The patient will need to take antibiotics until the wound is completely healed.",
        "Choice 2": "Because the patient’s wound was left open, the wound will likely become infected.",
        "Choice 3": "The patient will have more scar tissue formation than for a wound closed at surgery.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Because the wound edges are not approximated, more scar tissue will form. Although open wounds are more prone to infection, this is not an expected outcome, and antibiotics would not necessarily be needed. A patient with an open wound should not expect an extended hospital stay if wound care can be provided in the home or an outpatient setting."

        "Explanation": "Infection is a complication of wound healing that causes warmth, pain, inflammation of the affected area, and changes in vital signs (i.e., elevated pulse and temperature).\r\nDehiscence is the rupture of a suture line, whereas evisceration is the protrusion of internal organs through the rupture. A hematoma is a collection of blood that forms under the skin. It is usually tender or painful to the touch and is usually swollen. Granulation tissue is new connective tissue and tiny blood vessels that form on the surfaces of a wound during the healing process.

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Diabetic clients experiencing difficulty with blood sugar control are prone to the development of peripheral neuropathy, which results in decreased sensation in the feet and lower extremities. Decreased sensation in the feet places the client at increased risk for development of wounds or pressure ulcers in the feet. The nurse will know his plan of care is effective when the client’s feet remain free of wounds. An aggressive exercise program would not be appropriate for a client with severely diminished sensation in the feet. Similarly, a 1,200-calorie diet would be inadequate for most clients.

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Pressure ulcers are caused by unrelieved pressure that compromises blood flow to an area, resulting in ischemia (inadequate blood supply) in the underlying tissue. Friction and shear are extrinsic factors affecting skin integrity, which increases the risk of a client developing a pressure ulcer but is not the direct cause. Inadequate arterial blood flow to an area due to pressure causes the development of a pressure ulcer. Edema leads to compromised skin and tissue integrity, which is more prone to pressure injury."

        "Explanation": "By weighing the dressing before it is applied and after it is removed, the nurse can accurately determine the amount of drainage. Weighing the patient daily would evaluate his overall fluid balance but is not sensitive to fluid loss through the wound. Marking a circle around the wound is useful for determining the extent of drainage seeping out of a wound, but it does not provide information how much fluid is draining."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "A red wound indicates active healing, and the best treatment is gentle cleansing and a dressing that will ensure a clean, moist wound environment. Débridement is not necessary in this situation because there is no devitalized tissue present."

        "Question": "A patient has a stage II pressure ulcer on her right buttock. The ulcer is covered with dry, yellow slough that tightly adheres to the wound. What is the best treatment the nurse could recommend for treating this wound?",
        "Choice 1": "Dry gauze dressing changed twice daily",
        "Choice 2": "Nonadherent dressing with daily wound care",
        "Choice 3": "Hydrocolloid dressing changed as needed",
        "Choice 4": "Wet-to-dry dressings changed three times a day",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "A hydrocolloid dressing would conform to this area and form a protective layer against friction and bacterial invasion. It would also promote autolytic débridement of the slough and absorb the exudate from the autolysis. Dry gauze and nonadherent dressing (e.g., Telfa) would cover the wound but would not aid in removing the slough. A wet-to-dry dressing is a form of mechanical débridement. It would aid in removing the slough but is nonselective; therefore, it could cause damage to healthy tissue as well."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Alginates are highly absorbent and are appropriate for wounds with moderate to large amounts of drainage. They are ideal for wounds with tunneling, as they will conform to fill the tunnel. Gauze and hydrocolloids have limited absorptive ability. Gauze could adhere to the wound bed and cause trauma when removed. A hydrogel would increase the drainage, with the potential of macerating surrounding skin."

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "A 35-cc syringe with a 19-gauge angiocatheter is the best choice for irrigation because it will deliver the irrigation solution at approximately 8 psi. The water jet irrigation unit and 5-cc syringe with a 23-gauge needle would deliver the solution above the recommended pressure range of 4 to 15 psi. A bulb syringe is not an appropriate choice because there is an increased risk of aspirating drainage from the wound."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Aging skin tends to be drier. Sweat gland activity is diminished. The skin’s connective tissue, collagen, and elastin are reduced, which means the skin loses firmness and so wrinkles. Skin aging also occurs with exposure to oxygen-free radicals that are waste products from chemical reactions in the body as well as with exposure to certain food and environmental sources. An infant’s skin is thinner and more permeable to moisture in the environment."

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The client at greatest risk for pressure sores is the one with a lack of sensory perception at the site (e.g., quadriplegia). The infant with disruption to the skin from diaper rash is at risk for skin infection but not for a pressure sore. The young adult with diabetes is at increased risk for delayed wound healing but not likely for a pressure sore because he would shift weight in bed and respond to discomfort of pressure on a bony site. The older adult is normally at risk for pressure injury, but when mobile, even with an assistive device, the risk is minimal."

        "Choice 4": "Has lower back pain",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Heat therapy is used to relieve stiffness and discomfort commonly associated with musculoskeletal soreness. Heat causes dilation of the blood vessels and improves delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the tissues. It promotes relaxation and is used to aid in the healing process. Applying heat promotes vasodilation and reduces blood thickness (viscosity) and leaky capillaries, all of which would be harmful to the patient who is actively bleeding. It can lead to a drop in blood pressure. Heat should not be applied to a site with inflammation (insect bite or acute joint injury with swelling) because it can increase edema to the site. A good application for heat therapy is to promote comfort and relaxation to the patient experiencing back pain."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "2, 4",
        "Explanation": "During the inflammatory phase of wound healing, hemostasis and inflammation occur.

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "3, 4",
        "Explanation": "The Braden scale is a tool used to predict the risk of developing a pressure sore. Evaluation is based on six areas (indicators): sensory perception, moisture, activity, mobility, nutrition, and friction or shear. The Norton scale is another tool used to assess the risk for pressure ulcers based on the patient’s physical condition, mental state, activity, mobility, and incontinence. These are the two most used risk assessment tools in the United States. Both of these tools are used to identify persons at high risk of pressure ulcer development. The PUSH tool provides a comprehensive means of reporting the progression of a pressure ulcer. Surface area, exudate, and type of wound tissue are scored and totaled.

Data about the patient’s tolerance of suctioning provide information about the patient’s overall condition. The number of suctioning passes required to clear the secretions provides information about the amount of secretions present."

The patient is very restless. His respirations are labored, and you hear gurgling sounds. You auscultate crackles and rhonchi in both lungs. What is the most appropriate action to take?",
        "Choice 1": "Call the respiratory therapist to check the ventilator settings.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The nurse’s response should focus on correcting the patient’s misinformation rather than on convincing him to stop smoking. Once a person stops smoking, the body begins to repair the damage. During the first few days, the person will cough more as the cilia begin to clear the airways. Then the coughing subsides, and breathing becomes easier. Even long-time smokers can benefit from smoking cessation. The suggestions that the patient’s family will become ill and that oxygen is a fire hazard appear to be scare tactics, which can be seen as coercive, and would not be effective in motivating the patient to stop smoking. Although asking the primary care provider for a prescription may help the patient to stop smoking, it does not address his incorrect belief that it is “too late” for him to do so."

        "Choice 1": "Keep the head of the bed flat for 6 hours.",
        "Choice 2": "Immobilize the patient’s arm on the affected side.",

        "Choice 4": "Drain condensation into the humidifier when it collects in the tubing.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The drainage system must be below the insertion site to prevent fluid flowing back into the pleural cavity and compromising the patient’s respiratory status.  Maintain patient in semirecumbent position (head of bed elevated 30 to 45 degrees), not flat. This is extremely important to promote lung expansion, reduce gastric reflux, and prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), if the person is being mechanically ventilated. Patients being mechanically ventilated are at high risk for developing VAP, which is associated with high mortality rates. Mouth rinses and mouthwashes are a part of the recommended routine for preventing VAP. They also provide comfort and preserve integrity of the mucous membranes. Encourage the patient to move the arm on the affected side; if he cannot, perform passive range-of-motion. You should check the ventilator tubing frequently for condensation, and drain the fluid into a collection device or waste receptacle because condensation in the ventilator tubing can cause resistance to airflow. Moreover, the patient can aspirate it if it backflows down into the endotracheal tube. The fluid should not be drained into the humidifier because the patient’s secretions may have contaminated it."

Good peripheral circulation is characterized by strong peripheral pulses. Impaired tissue oxygenation to the kidneys would result in abnormal kidney function (e.g., poor urine output). Hypoxic limb tissue would result in abnormal muscle functioning (e.g., muscle weakness and pain with exercise). Adequacy of tissue oxygenation cannot be determined by assessing pulmonary ventilation alone; circulation must also be assessed."

Also to promote lung reexpansion, the nurse should encourage the patient to be as active as her condition permits, rather than telling her not to walk. Chest drainage systems are bulky, but patients with disposable systems can still get out of bed and ambulate. However, the patient will need assistance from one or two staff members to protect and monitor the system and to monitor her responses to activity; she should not get out of bed on her own.

        "Explanation": "As a toddler’s respiratory and immune systems mature, the risk for frequent and serious infections is less than in infanthood. Most children recover from upper respiratory infections without difficulty. Toddlers’ airways are relatively short and small and may be easily obstructed, and they often put objects in their mouth as part of exploring their environment, thus increasing their risk for aspiration and airway obstruction. In addition, toddlers are at high risk for drowning in very small amounts of water around the home (e.g., in a bucket of water or toilet bowl). The risk for developing asthma is not significantly influenced by the child’s developmental stage."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "2, 3, 4",
        "Explanation": "Obesity causes multiple health problems, many of which affect the lungs, heart, and circulation. Large abdominal fat stores press upward on the diaphragm, preventing full chest expansion and leading to hypoventilation and dyspnea on exertion. The risk for respiratory infection increases because lower lung segments are poorly ventilated, and secretions are not removed effectively. When an obese person lies down, chest expansion is limited even more. Excess neck girth and fat stores in the upper airway often lead to obstructive sleep apnea. Obesity also increases the risk of developing atherosclerosis and hypertension. Obesity does not cause reduced alveolar-capillary gas exchange."

In contrast, “BP will be normal . . .” does not clearly state the desired endpoint. Freedom from dizziness on rising is probably not achievable because ACE inhibitors are vasodilating agents, which may cause vessel dilation and hypotension, especially when the patient arises from a seated or lying position. Patients should be warned of this effect. The expected/desired effect of the ACE inhibitor is to lower the blood pressure; the urine output is minimally relevant in determining that outcome, if at all."

        "Explanation": "The QRS complex represents ventricular depolarization and leads to ventricular contraction. The P wave represents the firing of the SA node and conduction of the impulse through the atria. In the healthy heart, this leads to atrial contraction.  The T wave represents the return of the ventricles to an electrical resting state so they can be stimulated again (ventricular repolarization). The atria also repolarize, but they do so during the time of ventricular depolarization; thus, they are obscured by the QRS complex and cannot be seen on the ECG complex. The U wave is not always seen on the ECG but may be detected with electrolyte imbalance, such as hypokalemia or hypercalcemia. U waves sometimes occur in response to certain medication (e.g., digitalis, epinephrine). Inverted U wave may occur with ischemia to the cardiac muscle."

        "Question": "Three days ago a patient had cardiac surgery to bypass three occlusions of his coronary arteries. Veins for the bypass were harvested from his right leg. He informs the nurse that his leg is warm and tender in his right calf. The nurse notes a 3-cm periwound erythema and swelling at the distal end of the incision. Staples are intact along the incision, and there is no drainage. Vital signs are stable. The nurse would suspect that the patient has what kind of complication?",
        "Choice 1": "Deep vein thrombosis",
        "Choice 2": "Dehiscence of the wound",
        "Choice 3": "Internal bleeding",
        "Choice 4": "Infection at the incisional site",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a clot in the veins that are deep under the muscles of the leg. DVT can occur after surgery, after lengthy bedrest, or after trauma. Symptoms include pain, warmth, redness, and swelling of the leg. Dorsiflexion of the foot (pulling toes forward) and Pratt’s sign (squeezing calf to trigger pain) have not been found to be reliable in diagnosing DVT. Dehiscence is the rupture of a suture line, whereas evisceration is the protrusion of internal organs through the rupture. Internal bleeding is a wound-healing complication associated with hematoma formation, pain, hypotension, and tachycardia. Infection is a complication of wound healing that causes warmth, pain, inflammation of the affected area, and changes in vital signs (i.e., elevated pulse and temperature)."

        "Choice 1": "Keep the patient’s hips and knees flexed while the patient is in bed.",
        "Choice 2": "Apply compression devices (e.g., sequential compression devices).",
        "Choice 3": "Turn the patient frequently or encourage frequent position changes.",
        "Choice 4": "Promote adequate hydration by encouraging oral intake.",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "2, 3, 4",
        "Explanation": "Antiembolism stockings and SCDs are frequently used in perioperative patients to promote venous return and prevent clot formation. Turn patients frequently; teach patients to change positions frequently. This prevents vessel injury from prolonged pressure in one position. Promote adequate hydration to keep the blood from becoming viscous (“thick”). Viscous blood clots more readily."

        "Choice 1": "Nitrates",
        "Choice 2": "Beta-adrenergic agents",
        "Choice 3": "Diuretics",
        "Choice 4": "Anticoagulants",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "2, 3",
        "Explanation": "Beta-adrenergic agents block stimulation of beta receptors in the heart, lungs, and blood vessels and decrease heart rate, slow conduction through the AV node, and decrease myocardial oxygen demand by reducing myocardial contractility. Diuretics increase removal of sodium and water from the body through increased urine output. Diuretics reduce the volume of circulating blood and prevent accumulation of fluid in the pulmonary circulation."

        "Choice 1": "Decreased heart rate",
        "Choice 2": "Increased heart rate",
        "Choice 3": "Decreased cardiac output",
        "Choice 4": "Decreased strength of ventricular contractions",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 3",
        "Explanation": "Normally, the SA node is the primary pacemaker for the heart and initiates a rate of 60 to 100 beats per minute. If the SA node fails, the atrioventricular node can take over as the pacemaker, but it generally triggers a slower heart rate. Cardiac output will decrease as a result of the decrease in heart rate. Damage to the SA node interferes with the electrical activity of the heart but does not directly affect the pumping action of the heart."

        "Choice 4": "Brisk capillary refill",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 2, 4",
        "Explanation": "Individualized goals/outcome statements depend on nursing diagnoses you identify for the patient. However, for a patient with compromised cardiac output, you might plan goals, such as no shortness of breath with exertion, brisk capillary refill in nailbeds, and normal skin color with no pallor. Respiratory rate of less than 16 breaths/min is hypoventilation and can lead to poor oxygenation and tissue acidosis. (See Chapter 39 for more information about acid–base balance.)"

When you are gathering data in your client’s health history, she tells you that she is feeling more fatigue when walking up stairs and doing her normal household activities. What  normal physiologic changes in the cardiovascular system occur with aging?  Choose all that apply.",
        "Choice 1": "Cardiac contractile strength is reduced.",
        "Choice 2": "Heart valves become more rigid.",
        "Choice 3": "Peripheral vessels lose elasticity.",
        "Choice 4": "Heart responds to increased oxygen demands.",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 2, 3",
        "Explanation": "Cardiac efficiency gradually declines as the heart muscle loses contractile strength and heart valves become thicker and more rigid. The peripheral vessels become less elastic, which creates more resistance to ejection of blood from the heart. As a result of these changes, the heart becomes less able to respond to increased oxygen demands, and it needs longer recovery times after responding."

        "Choice 4": "Full compensation; the treatment plan is effective.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Full compensation has occurred as the PCO2 has returned the pH to the normal range. This change indicates that the treatment plan is effective. Partial compensation would be indicated by changes in the PCO2, but the pH would still be outside the normal range. The ABG is now complete compensation metabolic acidosis."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "An appropriate diagnosis is Impaired Gas Exchange. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results provide the defining characteristics for Impaired Gas Exchange. The ABG results demonstrate metabolic acidosis; however, this is not a nursing diagnosis. The patient has an actual problem; therefore, the “risk for” nursing diagnoses are incorrect.

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Restricting the oral intake of a patient with hypernatremia (Na+ greater than 145 mEq/L) would lead to further elevation in the serum sodium level. Infusing D5W IV fluid is appropriate, as this solution does not contain sodium. Hydrating the patient with D5W would reduce the serum sodium level. Strict I&O monitoring and laboratory evaluation of electrolytes every 4 hr would ensure that the patient is safely rehydrated."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Active transport occurs when molecules move across cell membranes from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration. Active transport requires energy expenditure for the movement to occur against a concentration gradient. In the presence of ATP, the sodium–potassium pump actively moves sodium from the cell into the extracellular fluid. Active transport is vital for maintaining the unique composition of both the extracellular and intracellular compartments. Diffusion, osmosis, and filtration are passive processes."

        "Explanation": "A balance of fluid and electrolytes is essential to maintain homeostasis. Excesses or deficits can lead to severe disorders. The kidneys are the principal regulator of fluid and electrolyte balance and are the primary source of fluid output. Specific hormones (e.g., ADH, aldosterone) cause the kidneys to regulate the body’s fluid and electrolyte balance. The heart and vascular system are involved in fluid balance but not in electrolyte balance and not as dramatically in fluid balance as are the kidneys—that is, they do not actually regulate electrolytes.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Hypovolemia may occur as a result of insufficient intake of fluid; bleeding; excessive loss through urine, skin, or the gastrointestinal tract; insensible losses; or loss of fluid into a third space. The first symptom of hypovolemia is thirst. Other symptoms are a rapid weak pulse, a low blood pressure (although initially the blood pressure may rise), dry skin and mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor, and decreased urine output. Temperature increases because the body is less able to cool itself through perspiration. The person with fluid volume deficit usually has elevated BUN (blood urea nitrogen) and hematocrit levels. Hypervolemia involves excessive retention of sodium and water in the extracellular fluid, and the vital sign changes are opposite those of a patient with hypovolemia. Hypernatremia and hyponatremia are not applicable because the patient’s sodium level is within normal range."

        "Explanation": "Moist mucous membranes and urinating every 4 hours would demonstrate restoration of fluid balance. Electrolyte imbalance does not necessarily occur with Deficient Fluid Volume; if electrolyte imbalance were present, the nursing diagnosis would be different. There is no evidence that this patient has a respiratory problem, so coughing and deep breathing are irrelevant."

        "Question": "A patient is receiving an IV infusion of lactated Ringer’s solution and 40 mEq of KCl at 100 mL/hr. When assessing the IV site, the nurse notes swelling, erythema, and warmth. There is a palpable cord along the vein, and the infusion is sluggish. The patient is complaining of pain at the site. The nurse would recognize these findings to be consistent with which of the following?",
        "Choice 1": "Infiltration",
        "Choice 2": "Extravasation",
        "Choice 3": "Hematoma",
        "Choice 4": "Phlebitis",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Phlebitis is an inflammation of the vein. It may be caused by the infusion of solutions that are irritating to the vein. Patients receiving IV solutions with potassium chloride are at a higher risk for phlebitis, as it is irritating to the vein. The symptom of a palpable cord along the vein distinguishes this as phlebitis. Infiltration presents as erythema, pain, and swelling. However, there is no palpable cord with inflammation. Extravasation is infiltration of a vesicant substance into the tissues. Differentiating symptoms include blanching and coolness of the surrounding skin; the formation of blisters and subsequent tissue sloughing and necrosis are later signs. A hematoma is a localized mass of blood outside the blood vessel. This is generally seen when a vein is nicked during an unsuccessful insertion of an IV line or when an IV line is discontinued without pressure applied over the site."

        "Choice 1": "Aspirate, then inject 0.5 mL normal saline.",
        "Choice 2": "Restart the IV line in a different vein.",
        "Choice 3": "Stop the infusion immediately.",
        "Choice 4": "Notify the primary care provider.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The nurse should first stop the infusion to avoid further tissue trauma. Because the IV has infiltrated, you must assume that the nurse has already checked the patency of the line by aspirating. There is no point in injecting saline because doing so puts even more fluid in the tissues. Injecting fluid to try to clear a clot from the catheter is not recommended because of the possibility of causing an embolism. Once the infusion is stopped, the nurse must assess whether the patient needs additional IV therapy. If so, a new IV line must be restarted above the site of infiltration or in the opposite arm. The nurse may need to inform the primary care provider if she is unable to find a new IV site or if she believes the patient no longer needs an IV."

        "Explanation": "Aseptic technique should be used with approaching the insertion site. Therefore, both nurse and patient should wear a mask. If the patient cannot wear a mask, have him turn his head away from the insertion site during the procedure. Sterile gloves should be worn when placing the new sterile dressing; however, procedure gloves are used to remove the soiled dressing. The nurse should stabilize the catheter while removing the soiled dressing but not apply pressure to the catheter-hub junction. The transparent dressing should cover the hub of the catheter, but not the catheter-hub junction; this makes it too difficult to remove without disturbing the integrity of the IV line or the site."

The kidneys are the principal regulator of fluid and electrolyte balance and are the primary source of fluid output. Specific hormones (e.g., ADH, aldosterone) cause the kidneys to regulate the body’s fluid and electrolyte balance. Oxygen saturation does not regulate fluids. It measures the saturation of oxygen on hemoglobin and is influenced by the partial pressure of oxygen, alveolar–arterial gradient lung disease, and the amount and type of hemoglobin (such as sickle cell anemia)."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 3, 4",
        "Explanation": "Acid–base balance is regulated by respiratory mechanisms, renal mechanisms, and buffer systems. Acid–base regulation can be monitored by examining arterial blood gases, especially blood pH. Buffer systems prevent wide swings in pH by absorbing or releasing free hydrogen ions. The lungs (respiratory mechanisms) control the carbonic acid supply via carbon dioxide. Conditions that cause retention of carbon dioxide, such as chronic obstruction pulmonary disease, lower the pH, whereas tachypneic conditions, such as hyperventilation syndrome, “blow off” carbon dioxide and increase the pH. The kidneys (renal mechanisms) regulate the concentration of plasma bicarbonate. By reabsorbing or excreting bicarbonate, the kidneys affect acid–base balance. Active transport involves the movement of fluids and electrolytes in the body."

        "Answer": "2, 3, 4",
        "Explanation": "Hypovolemia occurs when more fluid is lost than is taken into the body. Monitoring I&O provides information to evaluate the status of the problem. Encouraging fluid intake helps to correct the problem. It is good to monitor electrolytes because electrolyte imbalance can occur with hypovolemia (although it may not occur at first).

The opposite extremity (e.g., left hand) may also be used. The right saphenous vein is incorrect because that vein is located in the leg. The leg should be used as a last resort for an IV site.

        "Choice 1": "Needs an order to restart the anticoagulant.",
        "Choice 2": "Is concerned about continued use of the multivitamin.",
        "Choice 3": "Is concerned about the vitamin E dosage.",
        "Choice 4": "Has canceled the surgery so more lab tests can be done.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Both prescribed and over-the-counter medications may increase surgical risk. Many herbs can cause potassium loss and increase the risk for cardiac arrhythmias. High doses of vitamin E may increase the risk for bleeding. This patient’s use of 1,500 IU of vitamin E daily exceeds the recommended dosage, so the nurse should inform the surgeon of the vitamin E intake. Generally, the surgeon or anesthesiologist instructs patients to continue or discontinue taking their prescribed medicines. However, it is important to assess use of supplements and over-the-counter medicines. The nurse cannot cancel surgery without an order from the surgeon, who determines whether the surgery should be delayed or whether it is so urgent that it needs to continue as scheduled, even with the additional risk factor of the vitamin E dosage."

        "Question": "A patient is admitted for hip surgery. The patient usually takes the following medications daily: an anticoagulant, a multivitamin, and vitamin E 1,500 IU. He stopped taking his anticoagulant 4 days ago as instructed by his surgeon, but has continued to take the multivitamin and vitamin E. An important problem for this patient is which of the following?",
        "Choice 1": "Potential complication: anemia",
        "Choice 2": "Risk for infection related to inadequate anticoagulant dosage",
        "Choice 3": "Risk for noncompliance related to inability to follow instructions",
        "Choice 4": "Risk for bleeding",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The patient is at an increased risk for bleeding due to his intake of vitamin E. He may be at risk for anemia if he experiences a large blood loss in surgery; however, this problem is not appropriate before he experiences the blood loss. This patient does not have a higher-than-average risk for infection because he is not having surgery involving a “contaminated” system (e.g., the gastrointestinal system). There is no evidence to suggest that this patient is noncompliant simply because he stopped taking his anticoagulant as ordered."

        "Question": "A patient is admitted from a local skilled nursing facility to the outpatient surgery center for surgical débridement of a stage IV sacral pressure ulcer. The perioperative nurse discovers that the patient does not have a signed consent form for the surgery on the chart or in the surgery center. The patient says that she has not talked to the surgeon and that she has many questions regarding her surgery. When informed of this, the surgeon tells the nurse to have the patient sign the informed consent form, and he will review it prior to the surgery. What should the nurse do?",
        "Choice 1": "Follow the surgeon’s orders, and ask the patient to sign the surgical consent form.",
        "Choice 2": "Inform the surgeon that she will have the patient sign after he discusses the surgery with the patient.",
        "Choice 3": "Ensure that the signed surgical consent is witnessed by two nurses, because the surgeon is not available.",
        "Choice 4": "Cancel the surgery and transfer the patient back to the long-term care facility.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Informed surgical consent requires that the surgeon present information about the surgery to the patient, that the patient understands the information and agrees to the surgery, and that the patient has not been coerced to give consent. As a patient advocate, the nurse should verify with the patient that the surgeon has explained the procedure and answered all her questions. The surgeon is responsible for giving the patient the necessary information and determining the patient’s competence to make an informed decision about the surgery. If the patient has further questions, the nurse should notify the surgeon and delay sending the patient to surgery until an informed consent is obtained."

        "Choice 1": "Patients who have had surgical complications are observed in the PACU until they are stable enough to return to the floor.",
        "Choice 2": "Patients recover from the effects of anesthesia in the PACU and then return to the postsurgical unit for further care.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "A client remains in the PACU until he has recovered from the effects of anesthesia. In the PACU, the client is assessed every 5 to 15 minutes in order to quickly identify surgical or anesthesia-related problems. Most surgical units routinely admit patients to the PACU for a period of observation. Admission to the PACU does not indicate surgical complications or imply that a holding area is required. There is no reason the surgeon would need to explain this to the family, as the nurse could communicate the procedure. It is not usual procedure for a patient to be transferred directly from surgery to the postsurgical unit."

        "Explanation": "The intraoperative phase begins when the patient enters the operating suite and ends when the patient is admitted to the postanesthesia care unit. The nursing focus is to ensure patient safety during the surgical procedure by functioning as an advocate when clients cannot advocate for themselves and by monitoring the client and surgical environment throughout the procedure. Although the sterile field must be maintained in this phase and sterility contributes to patient safety, the focus of care is broader than the maintenance of sterility. Obtaining informed consent and preparing the patient for surgery are activities associated with the preoperative phase."

        "Explanation": "General anesthesia produces rapid unconsciousness and loss of sensation. During conscious sedation, the client feels sleepy but is easily aroused by touch or speech. Regional anesthesia interrupts nerve impulses to and from the affected area, but the patient remains alert. Local anesthesia produces loss of pain sensation at the desired site and is typically used for minor procedures. The client remains alert during local anesthesia."

        "Explanation": "The primary goal in home healthcare is to promote self-care.

        "Choice 1": "“Care is much more comprehensive and unhurried in the home; it is more enjoyable for nurses to work in home care.”",
        "Choice 2": "“Home care is much more organized than hospital care; you have access to the whole team, and there is less interference from others.”",
        "Choice 3": "“A home health nurse has more autonomy and skills than a hospital nurse; I’ll get to do more.”",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The home is the client’s personal environment: a window into the patient’s life. The nurse is able to see how the patient lives, interacts, and negotiates the world. Care, in the home and hospital, is comprehensive. In both locations, the nurse has obligations to other patients and will need to watch her schedule. The level of enjoyment a nurse has with her job is dependent on many factors. A disadvantage to home care is the lack of immediate assistance from other members of the health team. Home care nurses may be more autonomous than hospital nurses; however, their scope of practice is identical."

He is learning how to check his blood sugar and administer insulin. He has never given himself insulin, and he does not understand how to interpret his blood sugar readings. The physician has prescribed discharge from the hospital with home health follow-up. Is this an appropriate referral?",
        "Choice 1": "Yes; the patient is in need of skilled services and, therefore, is eligible for home care services.",
        "Choice 2": "Yes; the patient has been unable to control his diabetes, is noncompliant, and needs to be monitored.",
        "Choice 3": "No; the patient should remain hospitalized; he has too many needs for home care services.",
        "Choice 4": "No; the patient is relatively young and oriented; he should be able to provide his own care.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "A client must require skilled services in order to be eligible for home care services. This patient needs wound care, to be taught about diabetes care, and to be monitored.

        "Explanation": "Home care nurses more commonly use the CCC because it is linked to the OASIS reporting forms required by Medicare. The CCC was developed for use in home care; however, the diagnoses themselves are not specific to home care. They can be used in any setting.

The nurse should limit the supplies brought into the home if the conditions are not clean. Wound care supplies, for example, would be ordered and kept in the home.

Maybe.” On the table are several bottles of medication, some open, some not. They have all been prescribed for the patient. The patient cannot say how often to take each one, when asked. A compartmentalized medication organizer is on the table, with a few capsules in it, and some compartments left open. What should the nurse do?",
        "Choice 1": "Show the patient how to put the medications in the organizer for the next 2 days, and observe while he fills the rest of the organizer.",
        "Choice 2": "Arrange for a home health aide to come each day to show the patient which pills to take.",
        "Choice 3": "Administer today’s medications and arrange for the pharmacy to put medications in easy-to-open containers in the future.",
        "Choice 4": "Fill the organizer for each day of the week, explain how to use it, and return in a day or two to evaluate",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "From the cues given, it seems likely the patient would not be able to accurately load the medication organizer—and, in fact, may not be able to use it properly to take the correct medications at the correct time. The nurse would need to return every day or so until he is certain that the patient can actually administer his own meds after someone else loads the organizer. Showing the patient how to load the organizer solves part of the problem; however, this would not allow the nurse to evaluate whether the patient would then know to take the medications each day. Home health aides cannot be responsible for patient medications. There is no indication that the patient is having difficulty opening his medication containers, so there is no need to talk to the pharmacy."

In addition, he should not enter the building if he feels he may be in danger. He should notify the police if he senses danger, but not to tell them of a planned visit.

Telling the daughter to speak to the physician would place the physician in the same position as the nurse. Telling her that her mother has pneumonia would be a lie.

        "Explanation": "This illustrates the Outlining-options step. In Massaging the dilemma, the team would already have identified and defined the issues in the dilemma, and considered the values and options of all the major players. At the Outlining the options step, someone should delineate all of the options to all parties, including those that are less realistic and conflicting. In that step, someone often asks a member of the ethics committee or the hospital chaplain to help the parties understand the opposing viewpoints. Resolving the dilemma is the step in which all the options are reviewed and basic moral principles and frameworks are applied to arrive at a decision. Looking back to evaluate is done after a decision has been made and acted on. At that time, the entire process, including the consequences, is evaluated to determine how well it worked."

It is not a compromise—of any sort—because neither party backed away from its original position, and the action that was taken was not agreed on by both parties. This was not an effort to keep peace.

Although they are not laws, nursing codes of ethics specify ethical duties of the nurse to the patient as related to corresponding patient rights. Although patients do have a right to receive emergency medical care regardless of their ability to pay, this is not part of the nursing code of ethics.

A living will establishes the patient’s wishes regarding future healthcare should he become unable to give instructions. A patient may specify actions in a living will that are not supported by family members, such as a desire for a “do not resuscitate” order, or for as much or as little care as he wishes. A person may change or revoke an advance directive at any time. Changes and written revocation should be signed and dated and shared with the patient’s physician.

        "Answer": "1, 3",
        "Explanation": "Negligence and malpractice are non-intentional torts—nurses can be negligent without intending to do harm. Negligence is simply the failure to use ordinary or reasonable care as dictated by the standards of practice and/or by what a reasonable and prudent nurse would do in the same or similar circumstances. Intent is not an element of negligence. When a nurse or other licensed professional healthcare provider is negligent and fails to exercise ordinary care, it is called malpractice.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Computer physician order entry (CPOE) is technology that allows healthcare providers to enter orders into a computerized prescribing system instead of handwriting them. Orders are integrated with patient information, including allergy history and laboratory and other prescription data. The new order is then automatically checked for potential errors or problems. This reduces prescription errors resulting from illegible penmanship. It can detect dosing errors by flagging medication dilution or dosages that fall outside normal dosing standards. The system warns about the possibility of a drug interaction, allergy, or incorrect dose. As some drug names sound like other drugs, CPOE can alert prescribers and potentially avoid a drug error that could be serious or fatal. Although the efficiencies of the CPOE reduce costs, it is not the primary benefit of the system. Likewise, orders entered into the computer are more conveniently accessed by nurses and pharmacists, but the most important benefit of CPOE is to reduce errors."

        "Question": "At a recent nurse staff meeting, the chief nursing officer (CNO) announced that all nursing staff would work 12-hour shifts on a day–night rotation schedule that would alternate every 6 weeks. The CNO announced that she made this decision as a means to solve discord between the day- and night-shift nurses. She explained that this plan will allow the staff to experience the work on each shift and to appreciate the various job responsibilities on each shift. What type of leadership is the CNO displaying?",
        "Choice 1": "Management",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The authoritarian leader makes decisions for the group as a whole, gives orders, and bears most of the responsibility for the outcomes. A laissez-faire leader postpones making decisions or may never make a decision at all. Thus, laissez-faire leadership is really a lack of leadership. A democratic leader shares the planning, decision making, and responsibility for outcomes with other members of the group. This type of leader tends to provide guidance rather than control. There is no leadership style called “management.”"

        "Explanation": "The first stage in the change process is unfreezing. In this stage, the person leaves the stable comfort zone that has existed and begins to make changes.

The nurses have been trained in the new requirements and are documenting as requested, with the exception of one nurse. This nurse has been unable to attend any of the documentation in-service meetings and has been too busy to attend a private training session with the nurse manager. Meanwhile, she continues to use the old documentation process. What do the nurse’s actions illustrate?",
        "Choice 1": "Unfreezing",
        "Choice 2": "Active resistance",
        "Choice 3": "Passive resistance",
        "Choice 4": "Comfort zone",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Passive resistance behaviors include avoidance; canceling appointments to discuss implementing change; being “too busy” to make the change; agreeing to the change but doing nothing to change; and simply ignoring the entire process as much as possible. In the above situation, the nurse is not actively refusing to comply with the new documentation requirements; however, her actions are a passive approach to resisting change. When a person knows what to expect and how to deal with whatever problems arise in the course of a day, that person is operating within her “comfort zone.” The first stage in the change process is when the person begins moving out of the comfort zone, unfreezing. This nurse is resisting, not unfreezing."

He is clocking out 30 to 45 minutes late every day, even when his assignment load is light. The charge nurse describes his problem as “running from one duty to the next and having no organization or daily routine.” Which situation most likely describes this nurse?",
        "Choice 1": "Has time management problems",

        "Choice 4": "Is in a management position",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "This nurse most likely has trouble managing his time. Time management entails setting your own goals and organizing your work. Although there will be difficult days, the nurse who consistently finishes late and has no organization to his daily schedule has a problem managing time. Time management includes efficiently meeting clients’ care needs during a nursing shift and organizing one’s workload."

        "Choice 4": "Followership skills",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Empowerment is a psychological state, a feeling of competence, control, and entitlement that a person experiences. Empowerment refers to feelings, whereas power refers to action. The person who feels empowered has feelings of self-determination, meaning, competence, and impact. This nurse may have power on the unit because of her expertise, but there is no evidence that she is an authority figure. Empowerment is not always associated with management. Managers have authority by virtue of their position but do not always thrive in that role. There is not enough information in the scenario to judge the nurse’s followership skills."

The members of the therapy department state they do not have sufficient time to come to the nursing unit to pick up the patients and that patients often are not ready to be transported. Nursing staff members state that they do not have the time to transport the patients from the unit and this leaves a shortage of nursing personnel on the floor. Managers from both departments have attempted to resolve the conflict with input from nursing and therapy staff members. All attempts at conflict resolution have failed. What is the next step the managers should take?",

Most recently there was an argument about who would be scheduled for first lunch each day. At this stage of the informal negotiation, the manager is focusing on managing the emotions and setting the ground rules. Which stage does this demonstrate?",
        "Choice 1": "Setting the stage",
        "Choice 2": "Conducting the negotiation",

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The manager has begun conducting informal negotiation. This includes managing the emotions, setting ground rules, and clarifying the problem. The first step of conflict resolution is introspective and is similar to data gathering. The negotiator thinks, “What am I trying to achieve? What problems am I likely to encounter?” The next step, setting the stage, may involve confronting the two parties with their behavior toward one another and making direct statements designed to open communication and challenge them to seek resolution of the situation. After conducting the negotiation, the parties move to making offers and counteroffers, and then to agreeing on the resolution of the conflict."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "It is important to provide negative feedback in private. It is not necessary for the nurse manager to be present because staff nurses are responsible for delegating to and supervision of NAPs. The nurse should not call a meeting. It would be a waste of time for those who are already washing their hands properly, and it dilutes the effect of the feedback to the NAP who is not washing her hands. She might think, “Oh, everybody does it; no big deal.” It is important to allow some time every day for timely feedback. This allows the worker to know what she is doing right and wrong, and allows her to make corrective actions. The nurse should not allow this NAP to continue with her hand washing errors until her annual formal review because this can pose a threat to patient safety and increase the risk of transmitting infectious microbes."

        "Answer": "1, 2",
        "Explanation": "Biologically based therapies use substances found in nature, such as food, herbs, vitamins, and aromatherapy. These therapies are readily available and are often practiced as self-care measures, so people who do not wish to see a practitioner may not need to do so. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates biologically based therapies and is developing guidelines for good manufacturing practices (GMPs). However, dosage and manufacturing processes are not standardized. The Federal Trade Commission monitors dietary supplements for truth in advertising. At present, it is difficult to know what dosage you are obtaining from a product, and safety cannot always be guaranteed."

        "Question": "An elderly client with a history of COPD is having difficulty sleeping and does not wish to see a medical practitioner.

The client has not used any of these therapies in the past. Choose all that apply.",

        "Answer": "3, 4",
        "Explanation": "Aromatherapy is known to be safe, and may be effective. Tai chi is safe for older adults and may be effective for sleep. Yoga is possibly effective for sleep, but it is physically rigorous, so it has the potential to be harmful for older adults, who may have a variety of chronic conditions. The client should see a physician before beginning yoga. Melatonin is effective for certain sleep disorders, but it does interact with several prescription drugs. Therefore, the client should not take melatonin without consulting a physician."
