        "Explanation": "The filing of advance directives relieves the family of making those decisions at a more stressful time. It also gives back control over terminal care to the terminally ill person."

        "Type": "Single",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Showing that the nurse is experiencing a loss also helps the family deal with their grief. Showing empathetic emotion is not unprofessional. Automatic phrases such as “sorry for your loss” seem insincere."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "As death approaches, there is vasoconstriction to the extremities to keep blood going to the heart and brain. This causes mottling of the extremities. Bounding pulse and widening pulse pressure are not seen in the dying person. Cheyne-Stokes respirations are changes seen in the respiratory system, not the cardiovascular system."

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Finding a level of pain control that allows the patient to participate in care and communicate with family is the goal of pain control. Analgesics given before pain becomes intense can keep pain at a moderate level. Completely eradicating pain is usually not realistic."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Side-lying is a safe position for reducing the threat of aspiration. The supine position is not appropriate for aspiration reduction. Frequent suctioning is stressful to the patient, and fluids are never attempted for an unconscious patient."

End-of-life planning is a relatively new concept that the older generation did not experience in their youth. Persons are reluctant to talk about death issues, especially young persons, who do not see the need."

        "Choice 1": "“I’ll need to document well regarding the medications the patient is currently prescribed.”",
        "Choice 2": "“I would like to understand how supportive the patient’s family members are.”",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "It is a misconception that old age is synonymous with disease and illness. The nurse should always determine the patient’s sense of wellness and independence when conducting a health and history assessment. An assessment of medication use and family support is important for any patient. Many older adults do have chronic health conditions, but their perception is more important than a single number."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The transfer of the patient to a subacute facility is based on the need to maintain the patient’s level of function and independence, a task the acute care facility is not prepared to address once the patient is physiologically stable. The patient may or may not be happier in the new setting; the nurse should not make this judgment. It is true that insurance only pays for a limited amount of time in an acute care facility, but this is not the best reason for the patient to transfer."

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Normal albumin levels are above 15 mg/dl. Values below 5 mg/dL are considered a marker for severe protein deficiency. The nurse should enlist the services of a registered dietician to help manage this patient. Adding more protein to the diet and conducting a nutritional screening are not the best answers because the nurse already knows the patient is severely malnourished. Instructing the patient to maintain his or her good nutritional habits is incorrect."

        "Explanation": "A score of 3 or higher indicates moderate to severe nutritional risk. The nurse consults a dietician for a more in-depth nutritional assessment. Adding more protein items to the diet is probably a good idea, but this is not the most comprehensive answer. The nurse can reinforce the good eating habits the patient does have, but the patient needs more intervention. The patient may or may not need an iron supplement."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Older people do tend to eat fewer calories, making it more difficult to get all the needed nutrients. Stating that old habits are no longer good enough is not quite accurate. Extra nutritional reserves are a good idea, but the patient may not feel vulnerable to illness. Stating that it is in the nutritional recommendations does not give the patient useful information."

        "Explanation": "It is important that older adults, who as a group are at risk for inadequate fluid intake and dehydration, not reduce the total amount of liquids drunk in 24 hours. This is a common issue in the older population, so the nurse educates the patient on the amount of fluid he or she needs in a 24-hour period. Telling the patient “don’t be too restrictive” does not give the patient information to make an informed decision on fluids.

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Sleep disturbances, especially new ones, may signify a physical illness. Before simply taking medications or supplements to treat the sleep disorder, the patient should have a physical exam to rule out a physical cause for the problem. The other statements are not appropriate because for patient safety, he or she should have a checkup."

        "Choice 5": "The patient has taken sleeping medication in the past.",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 2, 3",
        "Explanation": "Characteristics of the sleep disturbance include difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying, asleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings, early morning awakening, and daytime sleepiness. An assessment should include questions related to the presence of these symptoms. Vivid dreams and sleeping medication are also part of a sleep history but are not characteristics of sleep disorders."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "2, 3, 4, 5",
        "Explanation": "As people age, the amount of time spent in REM sleep decreases, and this stage of sleep is interrupted more often by waking up at night. Stage 1 is the lightest stage of sleep and people tend to spend more sleep time in this stage as they age. Stages 3 and 4 are not as deep. The decrease in nighttime sleeping and increase in daytime napping can be attributed to alterations in circadian rhythms."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Older adults who lose their balance are able to right themselves to an upright position when the musculoskeletal strength of the hips, ankles, and shoulders is adequate. The inability to regain balance because of insufficient strength can result in a fall. The other options are also possibilities, but they are not as significant as hip, ankle, and shoulder strength."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "If joint pain develops and remains untreated, it can cause older adults to become sedentary or immobile. This phenomenon of disuse and muscle atrophy contributes to muscle weakness and can lead to an increase in falls. The other statements are also appropriate, but the patient’s pain needs to first be managed before determining if assistive devices are needed. Walking will help build strength, but the patient won’t do it if it hurts too much. Reporting symptoms does not directly affect falling."

        "Explanation": "If patients are unable to make informed choices and no family members are available, the nurse must use nursing judgment and follow an acceptable standard of care to promote safety and security that are defined and described in official policies and procedure manuals. The preferences of other patients do not indicate this patient’s preferences. Professional nursing knowledge can be used but must remain within the policies. Less restrictive interventions are preferable, but again actions need to conform to policy."

Smoke detectors work after a fire has started. Smoking during the daytime does not eliminate the possibility of falling asleep while smoking. Carbon monoxide detectors are important but not related to fire."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Slower reflexes and reaction times are a normal age-related change. Wearing glasses and hearing aids should correct the underlying problem and not be a cause for concern in themselves. Confusion is not a normal age-related change."

        "Choice 1": "“Older adults express less interest in intimacy as both acute and chronic illnesses develop.”",
        "Choice 2": "“Sexual expression is considered an enhancement to the quality of the older adult’s life.”",
        "Choice 3": "“Expressing sexual needs may be difficult or impossible for some older adults.”",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Although the need to express interest in sexuality continues among older adults, they face several barriers to sexual expression, including problems arising from low desire, aging, disease, and medications; societal beliefs; and changes in social circumstances. Sexuality remains important as people age and develop chronic and acute illnesses."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "In both genders, the reduced availability of sex hormones in older adults results in less rapid and less extreme vascular responses to sexual arousal. The nurse should first share this information with the patient then offer to talk more about concerns. Although this is a normal finding, simply stating this does not give the woman much information.

        "Explanation": "Erectile dysfunction (ED) can occur at any age. This patient’s chronic illness and its effect on the vascular system have priority when educating the patient about possible causes of ED. After discussing physiologic causes of ED, the nurse can then turn to psychosocial causes. Physical issues take priority over psychosocial ones."

        "Explanation": "Dementia may result in unmet sexual needs resulting in such behavior; however, this behavior may also indicate pain, hyperthermia, or the need to be freed from a restrained situation. Later the nurse can inform staff of the behavior, particularly if it is a new behavior, and ensure the patient has privacy. There is no need to cue the patient to stop this behavior as long as it is done in a private setting."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Nurses may feel intimidated or uncomfortable questioning older adults about their sexual desires and needs. To effectively assess the patient’s sexual history, the nurse must first reflect on his or her personal attitudes concerning sex and the older adult patient. The nurse should also gather information, assess individual patients, and, if needed, let the patient know the nurse will be asking questions related to sexuality."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Radical prostatectomy, a curative treatment for cancer of the prostate gland, involves a massive disturbance of hormone-producing glands, surrounding nerves, and urinary structures. This often results in temporary urinary incontinence and impotence. It may take 2 to 3 years to regain function. Referring the patient so quickly indicates a lack of willingness to discuss the issue. Prosthetic devices and medications imply the condition is permanent, and while the patient may need such assistive devices, the nurse should first provide encouraging information."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Although staff education about the sexuality and intimacy of older adults should include recognition of cues, desires, and interest in sexual activities, it needs to immediately address eliminating stereotypes, such as “the dirty old man” or “perverts.” The nurse is within his or her rights to limit behavior that includes touching inappropriately. A male patient may need to be reminded to keep his pants zipped. The staff member who is unsure how to help with sexual needs is expressing a legitimate concern."

        "Choice 1": "“Any time one engages in sex with multiple partners, the risk for contracting HIV increases.”",
        "Choice 2": "“Changes in vaginal tissue and immune function increase the risk, especially if sex is unprotected.”",
        "Choice 3": "“Unless you are engaging in unprotected oral sex, your risk does not increase substantially.”",
        "Choice 4": "“Yes, your risk of contracting a sexually transmitted disease (STD) including HIV, dramatically increases as you age.”",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The age-related thinning of the vaginal mucosa and subsequent vaginal tissue disruption, as well as age-related reductions in immune function, place older adults at increased risk for HIV infection. The risk does increase with increasing numbers of sex partners, but this combined with physical changes is the critical piece of information. HIV can be contracted through any sexual activity."

        "Explanation": "All patients have the right to sexual expression if they are cognitively capable of making decisions. No matter the sexual orientation of the patient, privacy should be respected unless the need for safety is paramount. The nurse should close the door quietly. There is no need for other action unless the staff members need to be reminded of this information."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Many of today’s older population grew up when sexuality was not openly discussed, so they may feel uncomfortable with this topic.

        "Explanation": "Education is the first step in this process. Once staff members understand that sexuality is a normal part of life at any age, the manager can provide tools for staff to use for assessment. Simply telling the staff to assess sexuality does not help them overcome their discomfort. Persons with cultural objections should be given extra time and attention to become comfortable with the practice, but they should realize that their patients’ needs come first. The manager may be able to negotiate a comfortable agreement with these staff members."

The patient may need more pain medication, but the sedating effects may be counterproductive.

        "Explanation": "Older adult patients actually underreport pain and are therefore at risk for undertreatment of pain, which may cause unnecessary suffering, exacerbation of the underlying disease, and reduction in activities of daily living (ADLs) and quality of life. Without this information the patient is unlikely to take the prn medication. “Why” questions are not therapeutic, as they place people on the defensive. The symptoms should be documented, but this should not be the only action."

The best way to control acute pain is through round-the-clock dosing (at least at first) to keep the patient’s pain from getting out of control. The nurse should assess the patient’s preferences, but should assess preferences for pain levels, because the patient may not be experienced in receiving pain medications.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Nutritional supplements for a patient with an eating disorder or dysfunction can decrease the patient’s susceptibility to infection by providing protein. The patient still may not be able to chew a mechanically soft diet. Oral care will help but will not decrease the problem. The patient needs protein, and it is best made available as a drink because of the chewing problems."

        "Choice 4": "screening visitors to minimize contract with pathogens.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Poor nutrition can contribute to a patient’s risks for developing a nosocomial infection, particularly among the older immunocompromised population. Many of the cognitively impaired older adults are already malnourished, so improving nutrition is a priority. Hand washing should occur before and after patient contact. A private room is not necessary. Screening visitors is not the best option; good nutrition will improve the patient’s immune status, although obviously ill visitors should not visit."

        "Explanation": "Individuals receiving corticosteroids, such as for rheumatoid arthritis, have a diminished inflammatory process and decreased immunity. Open ulcers anywhere can lead to infection, but chronic steroid use places the patient at high risk. Patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are in isolation. Being cognitively impaired does increase risk, but not as much as steroid use."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Older adults have an age-related decrease in immune function, plus this patient is on medication that diminished immune responsiveness. With the fresh wound, the nurse would be concerned about sepsis. The patient may be septic without showing local or systemic signs of infection other than confusion. Fall precautions and bed alarms may be necessary. The rapid response team is not needed."

        "Explanation": "As people age, their taste discrimination diminishes. The older adult can be advised to add extra seasoning (not salt because of concerns with cerebrovascular disease), add tart tastes, use sauces, and substitute other meats for beef. Soft food with gravy would be a good suggestion for the patient with dysphagia but would not be well received by the patient with diminished taste because of the consistency."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Older adults, with their diminished immune system, often do not develop classic signs or symptoms of infection, so a lack of fever and complaints and a normal white count do not eliminate the possibility the patient has an infection. Older adults frequently tend to have mental status changes with infection, so a normal mental status for the patient is a good sign that goals have been met."

        "Explanation": "The low clinical suspicion of HIV infection and delayed recognition of AIDS-defining infections contribute to the poor prognosis of HIV infection in older adults. The aging immune system is not able to eliminate the HIV residing in macrophages, lymphoid tissue, or the brain. Because the immune system’s regenerative capacity is diminished and not all replacement cells are fully functional, the disease progresses more rapidly than in a younger cohort. Tainted blood is not the primary means of infection in this cohort. About 31% of HIV cases are in older adults, and 17% of new HIV infections occur in people older than 50."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The majority of health care expenditure is spent on chronic illness. Patients with chronic illnesses have multiple hospitalizations for exacerbations of their conditions. Keeping chronic conditions under control would make a difference in health care cost. A telehealth service in which nurses could assess and counsel patients daily could help accomplish that goal. The other ideas are good too, but tight control of chronic conditions is a priority."

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "With exacerbations, the patient loses some control over an acute phase of the illness. The patient can be helped to maintain independence, control, and dignity by reassessing what is still within the patient’s ability and desire to control. The patient may or may not be adherent, but the nurse should not assume he or she is not. Teaching about the illness trajectory is one tool for giving control to patients.

        "Explanation": "Role reversals and role changes are common in families where an older adult has chronic illnesses. These lost roles need to be mourned by all involved. The nurse helps most in this situation by mediating a family meeting where roles, coping, and feelings can be discussed.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Helping the patient cope with fatigue is an important nursing intervention. The nurse should first ask the patient to prioritize the activities she or he most wants to do. Then the nurse and patient can plan strategies that will allow the patient to participate in these activities. Keeping a diary is helpful, but knowing what interests the patient most is more important. Rest and sleep are important, but they are not the priorities."

        "Explanation": "One in two adults has a chronic illness, and these problems are the leading cause of death in those over 65 and the largest cost to our health care system.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The aging cell has a tendency toward aberration or abnormalcy as it replicates. Aberrant cell growth is related to failure of growth control mechanisms, which leads to less cell regulation during replication. Cancer occurs more commonly in replicating than in nonreplicating cell groups, which suggests that changes in internal cellular control mechanisms give rise to cancer."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Most cancers are the result of a lifelong exposure, so the risk of developing malignant disease after age 65 is probably already determined by the time one reaches that age.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The curability of cancer in older adults is largely predicted by an individual’s ability to tolerate major surgery. The absence of metastasis and the tumor stage will impact additional treatments. Absence of chronic illness is not a factor in and of itself."

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Surgery may be indicated for palliative care in cases in which large primary or metastatic tumors can be reduced; the size or location of the tumor can create problems such as compression of surrounding tissues and organs, leading to pain, necrosis, or organ failure. Palliative procedures are designed to manage symptoms."

        "Explanation": "Frequent oral care is a must for patients with mucositis. However, commercial products contain alcohol, and the patient needs gentle products that do not contain alcohol. Saline is a good option. Documentation should occur, but the nurse should act to address the problem. A soft toothbrush or swab is preferred for comfort."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Physical needs take priority over psychosocial ones. The patient has open areas and impaired skin integrity, but no information shows decreased cardiac output. The pain is related to the impaired skin, so treating that will diminish the pain."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Cisplatin is an alkylating agent, which prevents RNA transcription and DNA replication. Antimetabolites interfere with synthesis of chromosomal nucleic acid. Antitumor antibiotics prevent RNA and DNA synthesis. Plant alkaloids bind to cell proteins and inhibit mitosis."

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The nurse should assess the patient for depression; however, prior to doing so, the nurse should review the patient’s chemotherapy. Some chemotherapy drugs can cause depression, and it may be a confusing picture. Depending on the results of the screening, asking about self-harm may be appropriate. Inquiring how the patient is feeling is appropriate, but it is not the most important action."

        "Choice 4": "Tell the family that the patient will get over it in his own time.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "This patient may be experiencing a compensatory form of grief and not allowing him- or herself to ponder the enormity of the situation at one time. Rather, the patient may be allowing bits of information to seep into his or her existence slowly in order to make sense of it. This is adaptive and the nurse should ask the patient how he or she feels about the cancer. Telling the patient that treatment must start early may be too harsh and the patient may not be ready to make decisions. The patient probably does not need a mental health professional; rather the patient should be left to come to terms with this diagnosis on her or his own terms. Using phrases like “get over it” are judgmental and imply the patient is doing something wrong."

        "Explanation": "Quality of life was measured by the Missoula-Vitas Quality of Life Index (MVQOLI), an instrument designed specifically for use with terminally ill patients. The MVQOLI determines levels of symptom distress, patient ability to function, social support, affairs in order, and religious comfort or support.

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 3, 4",
        "Explanation": "The classic clinical presentation of lung cancer is a persistent cough, sputum streaked with blood, chest pain, and recurring pneumonia or bronchitis. This constellation of symptoms is also associated with cigarette smoking, and their significance as indicators of cancer may be overlooked. Other symptoms include more systemic complaints such as anorexia, weight loss, and fatigue. Older persons more often experience dyspnea and weight loss, whereas pain is less frequent."

        "Explanation": "Instruct the patient and family to increase rest and sleep periods as well as to incorporate foods into the diet that are high in iron, such as eggs, lean meat, green leafy vegetables, carrots, and raisins. These interventions are directed toward conserving energy and providing iron. Avoiding strenuous activity will decrease the chance of injury. Bleeding and bruising would indicate low platelet count."

        "Type": "Single",

        "Explanation": "Physical symptoms are commonly associated with acute grief responses. Tearfulness, crying, loss of appetite, feelings of hollowness in the stomach, decreased energy, fatigue, lethargy, and sleep difficulties are common symptoms of grief. Other physical sensations may include tension, weight loss or gain, sighing, feeling something stuck in one’s throat, tightness in one’s chest or throat, heart palpitations, restlessness, shortness of breath, and dry mouth."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Loneliness and problems associated with the tasks of daily living are two of the most common and difficult adjustments for older bereaved spouses. Calling daily will help alleviate the loneliness. Taking over responsibilities may take away the only thing the patient “has left.” Learning to drive may be important, but the family should not encourage the patient to make a major life decision like moving now. Taking the patient on vacation is a nice idea, but this occurs yearly versus calling daily."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The third step in the process of mourning is the adjustment to an environment in which the deceased is missing. Older spouses have reported that they feel as though they will never “get over” their loss; instead, they have learned to live with it. It is nice to let the patient know you are here for him or her, but this does not give any useful information to help the patient. Telling the patient to focus on memories is dismissive. The nurse should not use clichés like “time will help.”"

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Exaggerated grief reactions occur when normal feelings of anxiety, depression, or hopelessness grow to unmanageable proportions. People with exaggerated grief may feel an overwhelming sense of being unable to live without the deceased person. They may lose the sense that the acute grief is transient and may continue in this intense despair for a long time. Re-reading diaries each night is the most specific example of this type of grief."

        "Explanation": "Mourning is often used to refer to the ritualistic behaviors in which people engage during bereavement. More recently, mourning is the term used for processes related to learning how to live with one’s loss and grief. The last task of mourning is emotionally relocating the deceased person and moving on with life. Going on a vacation with friends is a good example of this.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "One’s responses to loss and death are characterized by one’s natural reaction to all kinds of losses, not just death. People’s responses depend on their perception of the events and the meaning of the loss within the context of their lives and their physical, psychosocial, and spiritual life patterns. This behavior will likely be similar for all major losses, including the relocation of a pet. The other options do not demonstrate a grief reaction."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The goal of nursing care for older persons who are grieving and mourning is not to “make them feel better” quickly, although nurses are often tempted to try to do so. Nurses should assist and support bereaved persons through the grieving process, recognizing that pain is a normal and healthy response to loss and allowing bereaved persons to accomplish the tasks of mourning in their own ways."

        "Explanation": "For some older persons, the grief experience may include feelings of relief and emancipation, especially after prolonged suffering or a difficult relationship.

In this situation where the adult child died under such terrible circumstances, the family may feel they have no right to grieve when their child caused so many others grief. Anticipatory grief occurs when a death is impending. Masked grief is a self-protective mechanism for those who cannot bear the process of mourning. Complicated grief includes masked grief."

        "Question": "A patient has been grieving the loss of a spouse and seems to be doing surprisingly well when a beloved pet dies. The patient demonstrates extreme signs of sadness and despair, saying, “I cannot possibly go on without Kitty.” When working with the family, what does the nurse suggest?",
        "Choice 1": "Get the patient another cat.",
        "Choice 2": "Suggest the patient see the physician.",
        "Choice 3": "Refer the patient to a grief therapist.",
        "Choice 4": "Suggest they take the patient on a trip.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "This patient is demonstrating a delayed or postponed grief reaction. Doing “surprisingly well” may indicate a lack of grief response at the original loss, then an exaggerated reaction to a smaller, subsequent loss. The most appropriate action is to refer the patient and family to a grief counselor who can help the patient work through both losses. Getting another cat dismisses the importance of the first one. A physician visit may be needed, but a grief counselor is more appropriate. Taking the patient on a trip will not help resolve the situation."

        "Question": "The nurse in the emergency department cared for a patient who had a fatal heart attack. The nurse goes to meet the family in the private waiting room. The nurse is acting most appropriately when responding:",
        "Choice 1": "“What do you know about what happened today?”",
        "Choice 2": "“I’m so sorry but your loved one has died.”",
        "Choice 3": "“We did all we could, but unfortunately it was not enough.”",
        "Choice 4": "“Is there someone I can call for you?”",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Asking the family to recount what they know of the events helps them actualize the death, the first step in accepting the event. This allows the family to tell their story, at which point the nurse picks up with what happened in the emergency department. This also gives the family some time to prepare for the news of the death. Immediately stating the patient has died offers no preparation and will come as a great shock. Stating that what was done was not enough may imply that more could have been done. Asking to call for support may be confusing, as the family does not yet know the patient has died."

        "Choice 4": "Ask the patient to name children and grandchildren.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "During the life review, if patients can see that their lives were meaningful and worth living, then a sense of ego integrity emerges. The nurse can best assist this by asking the patient to relate memories that evoke pride in accomplishments. The other topics can be used to guide a life review but are too narrow in focus to be the best answer."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Nonpharmacologic comfort measures should be implemented first because of the erratic pharmacokinetics seen at the end of life.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Morphine sulfate is often used for dyspnea and has the added benefit of slight sedation, which will help this patient’s anxiety. Providing oxygen based on saturations does nothing for the patient’s distress; the patient may feel short of breath, even with an oxygen saturation of 100%. A cool fan may help. There is no indication that the patient needs a bronchodilator. IF the patient has wheezing, this would be appropriate."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Dying patients often have anorexia, and research shows that eating and drinking can actually increase distressing symptoms. However, the provision of food is universally seen as an act of caring and people place great emphasis on eating. The nurse can best help the family by helping them identify other ways to show caring. The other options do not give any useful information and could be seen as a cold response."

        "Explanation": "The key societal issue addressed by the age stratification theory is the concept of interdependence between the aging person and society at large. This theory views the aging person as an individual element of society and also as a member, with peers, interacting in a social process. The theory attempts to explain the interdependence between older adults and society and how they constantly influence each other in a variety of ways. Variation exists among the members of a cohort. Health problems are not the same for every individual of the same age. Withdrawal by an older adult is not a normal response to aging but may be a sign of depression."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "During the stage of ego differentiation versus work role preoccupation, the task for older adults is to achieve identity and feelings of worth from sources other than the work role. The onset of retirement and termination of the work role may reduce feelings of self-worth. In contrast, a person with a well-differentiated ego, who is defined by many dimensions, can replace the work role as the major defining source for self-esteem. Determining feelings related to the effects of aging, future death, or what the future may hold is not part of this theory."

The patient is now depressed and withdrawn and has verbalized feelings of uselessness. Which action by the nurse is best?",
        "Choice 1": "Encourage the patient take up a hobby that will occupy some time.",
        "Choice 2": "Explain that volunteering would be an excellent way to stay useful.",
        "Choice 3": "Assure the patient that these feelings of sadness will pass with time.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Volunteering will help the patient to interact with people and feel productive and valued for the ability to help others as stated in the activity theory. A hobby does not offer the chance to help others. Assuring the patient that feelings will pass is false reassurance and does nothing to help the patient to be proactive. Reminiscing is a valued activity, but it is not the best choice for regaining a sense of usefulness."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "It is important for the nurse to acknowledge the spiritual dimension of a person and support spiritual expression and growth while addressing spirituality as a component in holistic care without imposing upon the patient. Because the patient has made reference to the Lord, the nurse can safely offer religion-oriented spiritual care. Telling the patient there is no reason to believe that death is near does not help the patient work through emotions. Asking about calling the family is a yes/no question and is not therapeutic.

        "Explanation": "Older adults continue to feel valued and viewed as active members of society when allowed to maintain a sense of control over their living environment by attention to personal choices and rituals. Adhering strictly to policies does not allow for individualized care. Not all in the same age cohort will have similar interests.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Activity increases circulation, provides range of motion, and leads to clearer mental functioning. Activity helps a person remain independent and able to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental ADLs. Presenting information in a positive light that encourages the patient to take control of one’s own health is more likely to be successful than stressing the negative such as consequences of immobility or the concept of “use it or lose it.” Telling the patient that he or she will feel better does not give concrete information the patient can use to make decisions."

        "Explanation": "The no-longer supported disengagement theory posed that older people withdrew from society as they aged and that this was a mutually agreed upon behavior. The result would be isolation as the person became focused solely on him- or herself. Fear, anxiety, or malnutrition could be a further consequence, but isolation and withdrawal from society was “expected” according to this theory."

        "Explanation": "Although it is true that patients should be able to choose activities in which to participate, the best option is to assess the patient for frustration or anxiety associated with these types of activities. Once that is determined, the nurse can find other activities the patient can engage in successfully and is willing to participate in if the games are not an option.

Volunteering would offer the adult a way to stay engaged and provide a service to successive generations. Exercise and cooking classes would more fit in the biologic theories.

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Topical drugs face barriers to absorption because the aged skin has decreased water content, a relative decrease in lipid content, and a decrease in tissue perfusion. These changes may result in impaired absorption of some medications that are administered via lotions, creams, ointments, and patches. The other options are not related to medication effectiveness in this situation."

        "Explanation": "It is important to assess older patients for the possibility of alcohol withdrawal if agitation, hallucinations, anxiety, or seizures develop. Because the patient admits to a shot a day, it is possible she drinks more or uses alcohol to self-medicate for problems other than insomnia. The nurse should monitor the patient for signs of withdrawal as a priority, because this is a medical emergency. Slurred speech, lack of coordination, and nystagmus are signs of overindulging.

To complicate matters, patients may see more than one provider for the same health problem and may have prescriptions filled at more than one pharmacy. Additional contributors to polypharmacy include the use of over-the-counter and alternative medicines or supplements in the treatment of conditions.

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Normal aging results in the progressive loss of elastic recoil of the lung parenchyma and conducting airways as well as reduced elastic recoil of the lung and the opposing forces of the chest wall. The lung becomes less elastic as collagenic substances surrounding the alveoli and alveolar ducts stiffen and form cross-linkages that interfere with the elastic properties of the lungs.

        "Explanation": "An early sign of respiratory problems is a change in mental status. Because the physiologic responses to hypoxemia and hypercapnia are blunted in older patients, compensatory changes in heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure may be delayed and cerebral perfusion may suffer. Mental status changes may include subtle increases in forgetfulness and irritability."

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The key to pneumonia prevention is being appropriately vaccinated. All individuals should be vaccinated at age 65 unless they have conditions that lead them to earlier vaccination. Revaccination is indicated in certain circumstances. Signs and symptoms are subtle in the aging population. Minimizing contact during winter months is an appropriate suggestion, just not the best one. Vitamin C may have immune system benefits."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Because of the lifesaving modalities needed to care for such a patient, the nurse and physician work together to determine what the patient’s end-of-life wishes are. In the emergency department, patient stabilization comes first, but once this has been accomplished a discussion should occur with the patient and family about further treatment desires. The family caregiver may or may not be adherent, or the patient may assume all self-care. IV fluids should not be given at a rapid rate because of the risk of heart failure.

        "Explanation": "The nurse should instruct patients on side effects of medications. The nurse can assess if the patient wants to discuss this issue by opening the conversation with a “normalizing” statement, such as “many men have ED on this drug. Is this something you would like to discuss?” Although side effects do need to be brought up to the provider, the wording of this statement does not indicate a willingness of the nurse to engage in conversation.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "A frequent cause of hyperglycemia requiring hospitalization in diabetics is poor sick day management. The type 2 diabetic still makes insulin and so needs antihyperglycemic drugs even when ill. The nurse assesses the diabetic’s knowledge of sick day management. The other options are appropriate but not the priority. Better sick day management can possibly keep the patient from further, similar, hospitalizations."

        "Explanation": "Nursing interventions for nausea and vomiting include many self-help measures, including drinking clear liquids, progressing from eating bland foods to solid foods, and small frequent feedings. If vomiting occurs, fluid replacement should be a priority. Sips of fluids every 15 minutes until more can be tolerated may decrease episodes of dehydration. The position of the patient is unimportant. The patient should avoid nonclear liquids such as milkshakes. If the patient cannot keep even sips down, he or she may be prescribed NPO status."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "2, 5",
        "Explanation": "A patient with hepatitis best tolerates a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet. Several small feedings throughout the day will help alleviate the effect of anorexia. Favorite foods can be assessed but should not be encouraged unless they meet the dietary restrictions. Protein powder may be useful but is not necessary. Megavitamins are also not warranted."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 2, 3, 5",
        "Explanation": "By the age of 60, a person’s gastric secretions decrease to 70% to 80% of those of the average adult. A decrease in pepsin may hinder protein digestion, whereas a decrease in hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor may lead to malabsorption of iron, vitamin B12, calcium, and folic acid. This, combined with atrophy of the mucosa and a decrease in gastric secretions, increases the incidence of pernicious anemia, osteoporosis, vitamin B deficiency, and iron deficiency anemia."

        "Choice 1": "Passing a moderate amount of dark reddish-brown stool",
        "Choice 2": "Reporting a stabbing pain in the epigastric region",
        "Choice 3": "Asking for “some crackers to stop my stomach cramps”",
        "Choice 4": "Reporting the need to take antacid tablets “most days”",
        "Choice 5": "Having a rigid abdomen about 2 hours after eating",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 3, 4",
        "Explanation": "Typically the symptoms of DU are patterned by periods of exacerbation and remission and follow a pain-food-relief pattern. The pain begins 2 to 4 hours after meals, is immediately relieved by food or antacids, is located in the mid epigastrium, and may be described as a burning or cramplike pain. On physical examination, the only abnormality is possibly a tender epigastrium. A rigid abdomen could indicate a perforation of the ulcer. Stabbing epigastric pain is not a manifestation."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 3, 4, 5",
        "Explanation": "Nursing management of an older patient with hemorrhoids includes the prevention and elimination of constipation. This includes a review of high-fiber, high-roughage foods, including indigestible fiber like whole grains, legumes, and fresh fruits and vegetables. An adequate intake of fluids is also important. Older patients should be encouraged to consume up to 2000 mL of fluids each day unless contraindicated. This patient has heart disease and possibly should not take in that much fluid. The nurse should encourage light exercise on a regular basis and review the importance of a regular toileting routine. Rectal bleeding should be investigated."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Musculoskeletal aging changes increase the risk for falls in older adults. Approximately one third of those age 65 or older have falls each year. About 2% of this group is hospitalized as a result of injuries incurred during the fall. The other assessments are appropriate, but a history of falls is most predictive."

        "Choice 2": "Asking the patient to rate his or her current pain.",
        "Choice 3": "Observing the incision site for redness or drainage.",
        "Choice 4": "Monitoring the calf circumference on the affected side",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Major complications after joint replacement surgery include thromboembolism (deep venous thrombosis [DVT]), joint or wound infection, blood loss, nerve injury, joint dislocation, and surgical pain. The risk of DVT is highest between the first and second week after surgery. An increase in calf circumference can indicate the presence of a DVT.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Patients who have total hip replacement surgery are at risk for hip dislocation. The hip should be maintained in a position of abduction and neutral alignment. Some physicians may require the use of pillows or abduction splints while the patient is in bed. The other actions will not prevent dislocation."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The goal of total knee replacement surgery is to restore at least 90 degrees of knee flexion. However, the patient may have unrealistic expectations, so the nurse should first assess what the patient was told the outcome would be. The other statements do not give accurate information."

        "Explanation": "Exercise programs that include weight bearing and resistance have been shown to prevent bone loss. Beneficial exercises for older adults include walking, low-impact aerobics, vigorous water exercises, and racquet sports. Having a walking partner would be the best choice for this patient. The gym costs money and the classes may or may not be low impact. Bicycling and rowing are not weight-bearing exercises and do not promote bone growth."

Any change in capillary refilling, skin color, skin temperature, or excessive pain not controlled with medication should be immediately reported to the physician. This is the priority assessment. Pain is another important assessment, but circulatory status is first. The other actions are appropriate but not the priority."

        "Choice 3": "Functional",
        "Choice 4": "Stress",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Stress incontinence is commonly seen in older women who involuntarily lose urine as the result of a sudden increase in intraabdominal pressure. Overflow incontinence consists of frequent involuntary losses of small amounts of urine. Functional incontinence is manifested by loss of large volumes of urine because of a lack of awareness of the need to void or a mobility problem. Urge incontinence is accompanied by a sudden urge to void."

        "Choice 4": "“I lose small amounts of urine when I sneeze or laugh hard.”",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Typically, individuals with overflow incontinence complain of frequent losses of small volumes of urine, which are commonly a result of cystoceles. Burning indicates a urinary tract infection. “Not making it” to the bathroom is generally functional incontinence. Losing control of the bladder with sneezing or laughing is a manifestation of stress incontinence."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Treating urinary incontinence in individuals with cognitive impairment requires the use of other behavioral techniques that depend on the caregiver rather than the patient.

        "Explanation": "Approximately 80% of men may be diagnosed with BPH by the age of 80. In early prostatic enlargement, the patient may be asymptomatic because the muscles may initially compensate for increased urethral resistance. As the prostate gland enlarges, the patient begins to manifest symptoms of an obstructive process. The symptoms may include hesitancy, a decrease in the force of the urinary stream, terminal dribbling, a sensation of a full bladder after voiding, and urinary retention. Urethral obstruction may cause urinary stasis, UTIs, hydronephrosis, and renal calculi. Diabetes is not a risk factor."

Patients are approached on a regular schedule, asked if they are wet or dry, and then prompted to toilet. A patient should never be forced to toilet or reprimanded for failing to toilet appropriately. Self-initiated toileting should not be discouraged.

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Adjusting to the fact that dementia is irreversible and prolonged places families in situations of dealing with grief over a long period.

        "Explanation": "Positive responses to selected interventions may continue for a time but may decline as the disease progresses, which results in the need to reevaluate strategies. The nursing staff cannot evaluate the patient’s quality of life; only the patient can, and this patient is not capable. The family should be informed but that is not related to understanding dementia. The change in response is the result of advancing disease, not age."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Two of the most common side effects of many medications taken by older adults are mental confusion and disorientation. The initial action should be to determine the possible cause of the symptoms. If a cause can be found, a change might be possible. There is no indication the patient needs a PFT. Reorienting the patient is a good intervention, but it would be better to identify and eliminate the causative factor. Assessing a family history is a potential intervention as well."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Depression can and should be treated when it occurs with other illnesses because untreated depression can delay recovery from or worsen the outcome of the other illnesses. Cardiac illness is associated with depression, but not necessarily with anxiety issues. It is true that depression in the older population is underdiagnosed. Hospitalization can lead to depression. But the main reason to assess for depression is because of its effects on other health conditions."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Tertiary intervention refers to the restorative or rehabilitative functions that the nurse performs to assist patients in the recovery process. An important aspect of tertiary intervention involving patients with depression is teaching new coping skills to lessen the likelihood of recurring depression. Identifying early symptoms is a secondary prevention. Treating the depression will limit the physical symptoms. Education is generally considered primary prevention. However, in this case it is education on part of treatment. This is not the best answer because the nurse is not teaching about the drugs, only about the importance of being compliant."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "In this population, such symptoms may be mistakenly assumed to be a result of normal aging, so prescription medications may be ordered for anxiety, depression, aggressive and disruptive behavior, or paranoid-type behavior, without assessing the reasons for the behavior. If an underlying cause of the behavior is found, it can be treated, thereby eliminating the problem. The other actions do not demonstrate advocacy."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "One of the keys to successful aging is adjusting to or, perhaps more accurately, adapting to, although not necessarily accepting, changes that occur in one’s life. The nurse assesses the patient’s coping skills and methods. The patient does not need a support group before developing depression. Managing symptoms is part of coping. Educating the family is an appropriate intervention but is not the priority."

People who demonstrate symptoms of moderate to severe cognitive impairment may benefit from having meals in the same place at the same time each day. Small, frequent, nutritionally dense meals and snacks should be provided. During later stages of dementia, individuals may need to be reminded to open the mouth and chew.

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Compression is the mainstay of venous ulcer treatment, and it should be applied when there is brownish skin and edema. The taut white shiny skin and faint pulses indicate arterial insufficiency, and compression will compromise circulation in those extremities even further.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "A Braden scale score of 13 indicates high risk for developing a pressure ulcer. The most important intervention is to turn the patient frequently. Good nutrition is important for wound healing and prevention, but a high-protein snack and monitoring prealbumin do not immediately impact the patient’s skin condition.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Xerostomia, commonly referred to as dry mouth, is a subjective sensation of abnormal oral dryness. Reduced salivary flow is a common complaint of older adults. Dry mouth in the older adult can lead to an increased risk of serious respiratory infection, impaired nutritional status, and reduced ability to communicate. Offering appropriate fluids with meals will assist with proper nutrition. The other options will not provide relief for this condition."

Because the patient is nonverbal, the nurse must assess for pain with behavioral changes. The nurse should contact the provider about obtaining an ophthalmologic exam to determine if the patient has glaucoma. The other interventions will not help determine the cause of the problem.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The patient should be using punctal occlusion (closing the lacrimal duct) when instilling these eyedrops to avoid a cumulative, systemic effect from the combination of both beta-blockers.

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "To be responsive to the legal obligation to report reasonably suspicious acts of abuse and because there is great variation among the states, nurses should determine the specific reporting requirements of their jurisdictions, including where reports and complaints are received and in what form they must be made. The statements that the nurse is a mandatory reporter and that abuse should be reported if suspected are true, but they do not help the nurse learn to handle the complaint. The manager may want to know about claims of abuse and it may be facility policy to report up the chain of command, but the nurse is responsible for filing the formal complaint."

The patient does have the right to self-determination, but the staff must ensure the patient’s safety. Vest restraints do require an order, but environmental measures must be tried before chemical or physical restraints.

Based on the person’s medical condition, subtle signs such as a gesture or a nod of the head may be easily overlooked. The patient may or may not be able to discuss her condition.

        "Explanation": "Even when a patient exhibits disorientation, any report of mistreatment or neglect is to be considered reasonably suspicious and so should be reported. Bruises in the genital area raise suspicions of abuse. The family stating caregiving is hard does not mean they don’t have enough support to cope. Mild changes in orientation may be expected in a disoriented patient. The patient who is always hungry should be followed up with a nutrition assessment, and this may or may not be a sign of abuse."

        "Explanation": "Drugs should not be used to control behavior. If used to manage health conditions, the patient should show improvement. The patient who is now able to participate in activities shows an increase in functional ability, so this medication is therapeutic for this patient.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Declining physiologic function and increased prevalence of disease, particularly in the old-old (age 85 or older), are in part a result of a reduction in the body’s ability to respond to stress through all of its homeostatic mechanisms. The important point is that older adults often encounter profound and repeated losses; the time between the occurrences of these losses is often short, resulting in an inadequate period for resolution and return to a baseline state, thus putting them at risk for illness. Although the other patients may have compromised homeostatic mechanisms, the 86-year-old patient is most likely to exhibit this phenomenon."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "To ensure a successful interview, the nurse should explain the reason for the interview to the patient followed by a brief overview of the format to be followed. This helps alleviate anxiety and uncertainty, and the patient can then focus on providing the information. The other options are all important actions during the assessment interview, but they will not diminish anxiety as much as an explanation of the purpose."

The only abnormal assessment values include a heart rate of 102 beats per minute, slight cyanosis of the nail beds, and mild confusion. The patient’s daughter questions the possibility of pneumonia stating, “He isn’t coughing or having any difficulty breathing.” The nurse responds most appropriately by saying:",
        "Choice 1": "“We are lucky to determine the problem in its early stage.”",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The characteristic presentation of illness in older adults is more commonly one of blunted or atypical signs and symptoms. Stating, “we are lucky to determine the problem” does not give any useful information. Respiratory problems are often present early on in younger people. The lack of coughing is not caused by weakness."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "A sudden change in an older adult patient’s cognitive status is likely a symptom of a physiologic stressor such as an infection. The vital signs will allow the nurse to determine the presence of a fever or other deviation from the patient’s baseline vitals. The patient may or may not need or wish to go to bed, but this does not provide any data for the nurse to evaluate. An ill patient may need to be on fall precautions, but again this does not provide data. Reorientation may be necessary, but if the patient has an illness, this needs to be taken care of."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "This goal-directed interviewing process helps the patient share pertinent information through remembering. The tendency to reminisce may make it difficult for the patient to stay focused on the topic, so it is the nurse’s responsibility to refocus the interview when necessary. Reminding the patient to share memories, using several short interviews, and controlling the interview do not make best use of this technique."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The nurse’s own anxiety and fear of personal aging as well as a lack of knowledge regarding older people contribute to commonly held negative attitudes, myths, and stereotypes about older people that interfere with a successful, effective assessment interview. The nurse must acknowledge the age-related differences in this patient. The nurse does use therapeutic communication, but this may be hampered by unrealized stereotypes. The nurse should treat all patients with respect, but this statement does not give specific information on how to do so."

        "Explanation": "Specifically, the purpose of older adult assessment is to identify patient strengths and limitations so that effective and appropriate interventions can be delivered to support, promote, or restore optimum function and to prevent disability and dependence. Physiologic baseline, therapeutic nurse-patient relationship, and self-care deficits are all important aspects of the assessment but not the major purpose for it."

When a part gives out or is functioning abnormally, traditional Western medical treatment is sought and expected. The magico-religious models believe that health is a reward from a higher power.

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Ethnocentrism is a belief that one’s own cultural group is superior to that of another’s. In nursing we have a unique culture and expect our patients to adapt to us rather than attempting to adapt to the culture of the patient. Confiscating items used in healing rituals shows ethnocentrism and disrespect to the resident. Limiting activities in a group room, encouraging people to attend church services of their religion, and letting prospective Jewish residents know that the facility does not have a kosher kitchen are not examples of ethnocentrism."

The needs of the group are more important than those of the individual, and decisions are made with consideration of the effect on the whole.

Persons from strong cultural backgrounds cannot just change their behavior when instructed to do so. The nurse explains this to the student.

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 3, 4",
        "Explanation": "Self-reflection implies thinking that regards how “I,” the individual, perceives/believes/behaves. Awareness of one’s thoughts and feelings about others who are culturally different from oneself is necessary to become culturally aware. No culture is “worthy” of biased treatment. “Solid” science is an ethnocentric principle."

        "Explanation": "Hispanics are expected to be the largest minority group in the United States by 2030. Many persons of color are not represented in the census, and this underestimates their presence.

The student wants to know why the patient’s minor child, who speaks English, cannot interpret. What response by the nurse is best? (Select all that apply.)",
        "Choice 1": "The child may not accurately translate.",
        "Choice 2": "The child and older adult may be embarrassed.",

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 2, 3",
        "Explanation": "Although in a true emergency the nurse may have to use a child interpreter, this practice is not recommended. The child may not have the vocabulary to translate, the child may “edit” the comments, the child or older adult may be embarrassed by the medical condition, and patients have a legal right to professional interpretation.

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Preserving a patient’s autonomy through independent living is vital to a patient’s sense of well-being and can often be preserved through cooperation between family members to provide the required support. If the nurse can help the family find internal or external resources to support the patient’s desire to live independently, that is a win-win for all involved. Assuring the family that safety is not an issue does not help resolve their anxiety. The nurse can arrange a referral but can do more to help with this situation. A short-term trial of home health services is often accepted, but it does not address the entirety of the situation."

        "Explanation": "Caregivers need realistic information regarding the possible progression of the disease process and how that will affect patient needs/care. The nurse provides anticipatory guidance and helps the family identify issues that may occur in the future. Stating you are glad the family voiced concerns is caring but does not address the issue.

        "Explanation": "Family members often feel they have failed. They may need help to recognize when “failures” are the result of a challenging situation and not their performance. Giving objective information about the patient’s medical condition and the consequences of not following the medical regime can help alleviate guilt. The nurse may need to evaluate the care the patient gets, but that puts the entire responsibility back on the family, which is counterproductive. Care may need to be assumed by a professional, but the nurse should first help the family with their feelings. Suggesting this prematurely can lead to increased guilt.

        "Explanation": "The nurse should help caregivers recognize that caregiving is a job. Just as employees benefit from regular breaks and vacations, caregivers benefit from a “break” in the job. The nurse should emphasize that the need for respite care begins with the onset of caregiving. Explaining the plan of care, encouraging the family to seek assistance, and providing written information are all appropriate, but home caregivers face multiple stressors and need to care for themselves too."

Children should convey that they do not want to know how much their parents have or might leave in their will; rather, they want to make sure there is a current and complete plan. A lawyer or social worker can assist in this process, but unless the patient believes the children are acting in his or her best interests, the other professionals will likely encounter resistance as well.

        "Explanation": "By listening to and consulting with older adults, the nurse develops an understanding of the values and perceptions that guide older adults’ thoughts and feelings about life. The nurse forms partnerships with older adults to defend and promote their rights. The other options are nice to know but not required to be an advocate."

        "Explanation": "Older adults tend to feel an obligation to return favors. If someone does something for them, such as helping them to get their food, they want to be able to reciprocate. If they are financially unable to do this, they might withdraw so as not to be put in an embarrassing position."

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Persons of this cohort (raised during the American depression of the 1930s) are generally frugal and often do not spend money, even if they have it. Suggesting a cost-effective way to purchase the medications will particularly appeal to this patient."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Women and men who served in the armed forces during this time became accustomed to preventive medical and dental care. Those influenced by the Great Depression are more likely to hoard money. Families started becoming more mobile. This cohort is not as likely to be noncompliant because of cohort influences."

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Social networks are invaluable to help mitigate the effects of major life events on health. The nurse can encourage the patient to join groups or organizations in order to make new friends. Staying in touch with family may or may not be desired. The patient may need assessment for substance abuse, but this is not the best action. Asking “why” questions often puts people on the defensive, and this technique is not considered a therapeutic communication tool."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Depressed or negative older adults have trouble maintaining relationships. If this is a change in status, the nurse should determine if the patient needs a checkup to look for underlying illness. The other answers do not provide action that could possibly alleviate the situation. Giving the patient medications without a full workup is dangerous."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Individuals who move can suffer from relocation stress, which is a negative consequence of moving. If the patient has input into the facility chosen, can take tours, and can bring cherished personal items with him or her, the chances of relocation stress lessen. Although there might be limited room, it is more important for the family to let the patient take wanted items. Moving precipitously can increase the chance of relocation stress. The family should be warned about the negative reactions to moving that are possible, but this does not give them the ability to lessen the impact."

        "Explanation": "Patients often withdraw and become isolated when they do not feel safe in their surroundings. The nurse should first assess the patient’s perception of safety.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Older people who are lonely may welcome “visits” from unscrupulous visitors. They are also less likely to hang up the phone or close the door to avoid appearing impolite. The nurse can best help this patient by telling her such behavior is not only all right, it is important for her safety. The other actions are also possible but can be costly, and the patient may not have a reliable neighbor."

Some older adults do place high value on saving money, but not all older adults are influenced by this desire."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Objective information is best obtained when observing general appearance and various body system indicators of nutritional status. Note height, weight, and fit of clothes. If possible, observe the older adult eating a meal. Food available in the home does not indicate the patient’s knowledge, as someone else may have bought the food. Asking the patient for information is requesting subjective data. Reviewing a healthy diet does not allow the patient to demonstrate knowledge."

        "Explanation": "Subjective data can be obtained through the health history. Asking the patient to identify how often the bowels move would establish the fundamental baseline of the patient’s elimination patterns. “Normal” is a vague term that should not be used. Asking if there are problems with constipation or if bowel habits have changed are yes/no questions, which are generally avoided."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "According to this theory, self-efficacy and outcome expectations are influenced by successful performance of the behavior, verbal encouragement, seeing similar people do the behavior, decreasing unpleasant aspects of the behavior, caring approaches to facilitate the behavior, and education about benefits. A local walking club with other seniors fulfills many of these criteria. Private nutritional counseling does not allow the participant to see others engaged in this activity. Meals may or may not be healthy or palatable. Educational materials on their own may not have great benefit."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Secondary prevention is screening and early diagnosis. It aims to find people with clinical conditions that have not yet become apparent to them. Blood pressure screening would fit this description. Flu vaccinations and teaching about sun exposure are examples of primary prevention. Fitting older adults with glasses is a tertiary prevention."

        "Explanation": "Competing priorities often cause patients to seem uninterested or “noncompliant” with health recommendations. According to Maslow, basic needs such as food, water, shelter, and safety take priority over other matters. Perhaps it is a good idea to take shots into the community, but that is not the best response by the nurse, as it does not help the student understand the situation.

        "Explanation": "Adverse drug reactions frequently precipitate hospitalizations and, although often unreported, are among the most common iatrogenic events in the acute care setting. The hospital staff needs to get an accurate drug history of a patient, be aware of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes related to aging, and have a working understanding of drug-disease, drug-drug, and drug-food interactions in older adults. Nurses should be particularly aware of drugs that may be high risk when used in older adults.

        "Explanation": "Once older adults are hospitalized, immobilization through enforced bed rest or restraint often results in functional disability, and the subsequent occurrence of iatrogenic illnesses often represents a vicious circle, referred to as the cascade effect, in which one problem increases the person’s vulnerability to another one. Gerontologic nurses must be leaders in advocating more appropriate care and treatment of hospitalized older adults to prevent or at least reduce the occurrence of iatrogenic illness.

        "Explanation": "The enjoyment of physical activity is a positive aspect of this man and thus can be included in the nurse’s plan because he already incorporates an important part of diabetic care into his life and, potentially, enjoys the health benefits of exercise. Practicing effective glucose control demonstrates this man’s resilience and capacity to manage effectively the challenges associated with a chronic illness and thus is a strength the nurse can use in a positive approach toward his health and well-being. This man has a social network that helps him to live with diabetes and to prevent the long-term complications of diabetes.

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Constipation is present when fewer than three bowel movements occur per week or when the frequency decreases. Mineral oil and saline laxatives can be harmful. Fiber, fruit, and fluids are the first recommendations; stimulant laxatives such as senna and cascara can be used on a short-term basis. Altered cognitive status, increased agitation, and unexplained falls can be symptoms of constipation; these behaviors may be the only clinical symptom of constipation in cognitively impaired older persons. Excessive sleep has not been identified as a symptom. Liquid feces may be leaking around a fecal impaction, and antidiarrheal treatment can aggravate the impaction."

        "Explanation": "The nurse recognizes that incontinence is a sign of an underlying problem and not an inevitable result of aging. In addition, the nurse offers dignity, hope, and understanding by maintaining a positive and respectful manner and by communicating that effective treatments are available. Rubber garments, in particular, are hot and can cause skin irritation. Internal catheters should be used only for a short time and under limited circumstances. Using a smooth muscle relaxant is indicated only for urge incontinence and for an overactive bladder."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Difficult access to facilities within the time available is a factor in bowel incontinence and bladder incontinence. The intake of 1 L of fluid is less than the recommended amount to protect against dehydration and constipation. Realistic expectations and goals should be discussed with the patient. Toileting should occur 20 to 40 minutes after regularly scheduled meals when the gastrocolic reflex is active."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "This older adult is at high risk for developing constipation as a result of being on bed rest and being prescribed an opiate for pain. A decrease in activity, combined with the use of an opiate, often leads to constipation, not diarrhea. Appetite can be poor for the first few days after surgery, but it often returns without incidence. Decreased fluid intake is often supplemented with intravenous fluids for the first few days after surgery."

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The nurse assesses the older adult’s mental status. Changes in mental status, character of urine, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, chills, low back pain, urethral discharge in men, new onset of incontinence, or even respiratory distress may signal a possible UTI in older people. An indwelling catheter does not often cause a decrease in activity."

        "Choice 1": "Limit oral fluid intake.",
        "Choice 2": "Apply absorbent undergarment.",
        "Choice 3": "Provide regular toileting.",
        "Choice 4": "Encourage frequent rest periods.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The nurse provides regular toileting to promote voiding and to prevent incontinence for a resident with a potential cognitive impairment. The nurse avoids limiting oral fluid intake; older adults, especially those living in residential facilities, are at higher risk for dehydration than younger people. Using absorbent undergarments may be unnecessary if the incontinence can be controlled with regular toileting. Nursing research supports the claim that ambulatory residents are less likely to be incontinent. This resident may have dementia, but maintaining mobility will have a greater impact in preventing incontinence."

        "Explanation": "The Nursing Standard Practice Protocol is a resource for urinary incontinence in older adults admitted to acute care. The Borun Center provides training modules suitable for nurses managing incontinence in residents in long-term care facilities. The American Geriatrics Society helps with managing urinary incontinence in primary care settings. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services supply guidelines for managing urinary incontinence in long-term care facilities."

        "Choice 1": "Begin a low-calorie diet for weight management.",
        "Choice 2": "Schedule voiding at 2- to 4-hour intervals.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Healthy bladder behavior skills include scheduling voiding at 2- to 4-hour intervals for residents either independently or with prompting. Beginning a low-calorie diet can be a reasonable approach to urinary incontinence, but the nurse first applies low-cost behavioral techniques. Pelvic floor exercises will help control urinary incontinence. Bladder training involves increasing the time between the urge to void and voiding."

        "Choice 4": "Schedule voiding for every 2 hours around the clock.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The nurse practitioner recommends pelvic floor exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor and the muscles that surround the urethra, vagina, and rectum to decrease the incidence of stress incontinence. Stress incontinence is usually due to weakened pelvic floor muscles; therefore eliminating caffeinated beverages can be an ineffective treatment. Arranging a family conference is premature and potentially embarrassing for the older adult. Many therapies are available to decrease this older adult’s incontinence. Scheduled voiding is recommended at 2- to 4-hour intervals during the day and at 4-hour intervals at night."

The catheter should be removed and replaced daily and the penis cleaned, dried, and aired to prevent irritation, maceration, and the development of pressure ulcers and skin breakdown.

It takes older adults more time to fall asleep, and older adults are awakened throughout the night more frequently than younger people. Benzodiazepines should not be used to induce sleep; these substances are highly addictive, and if their administration is suddenly withdrawn, then rebound insomnia can occur. In addition, older adults who take benzodiazepines for sleeping are more likely to experience a “hangover” after waking that can increase the risk of accidents and injuries. In addition to alleviating depression that causes sleep disorders, SSRIs can have a stimulating effect that, in itself, interferes with the sleep cycle."

        "Choice 1": "Instruct the wife to increase his daily physical activity.",
        "Choice 2": "Collaborate with the health care provider to administer a hypnotic medication.",
        "Choice 3": "Teach the wife how to apply a vest restraint during sleep.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Regular exercise can help increase the duration of sleep during the night. Adding a new medication to the existing pharmacotherapy can increase adverse drug interactions and complicate the problem; the existing therapeutic regimen can be already contributing to the problem. Administering a hypnotic medication is the therapy of last resort and can be ineffective. The nurse avoids recommending the use of restraints; restraint use is associated with an increased incidence of injury and accidents. In addition, restraints can be an ineffective therapy and can contribute to hostility and combativeness. Excessive napping during the day may be contributing to the problem."

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Exercises that improve muscle strength are important for balance, strong bones, and metabolic processes. Relative intensity is the level of effort required by a person to an activity. When using relative intensity, people pay attention to how physical activity affects heart rate and breathing. Muscle strength is not a therapeutic concern. Muscle retraining refers to muscles that have been trained, detrained, and trained again and is not a therapeutic concern. Muscle definition is a quality valued by bodybuilders, but it is not a therapeutic concern."

        "Explanation": "Any aspect of the patient’s current and past physical and psychological condition can be important in designing the exercise program to suit the patient. Fitness tests such as the ETT are warranted in older adults who are beginning a moderately intense or vigorous exercise program. The ETT is not recommended for the frail older adult.

        "Explanation": "Hospitalization often disrupts normal sleeping patterns; therefore reestablishing those patterns is the best first step to improving the quality of sleep in the hospital. Avoiding napping during the day is a reasonable approach to complaints of sleeplessness, but it may not be this woman’s problem. Sleep is increasingly fragmented in older adults; however, understanding that issue may or may not help this woman sleep for longer periods. A book or movie can help some people become drowsy, but becoming drowsy will not usually increase the quality or duration of sleep.

        "Explanation": "The resident’s ability for self-care is deteriorating, and needing help with personal hygiene is an indicator of declining health because the level of activity is an indicator of an individual’s health and wellness. Thus declining health is the nurse’s priority in planning care. Assessing and addressing medical problems, such as heart disease and nutrition, and improving sleep are among the aspects of care to restore health and well-being for which the nurse will plan. Improving sleep patterns is part of the overall plan to restore her health and wellness.

        "Choice 1": "New-onset urinary tract infection",
        "Choice 2": "Trends over time in activity level",
        "Choice 3": "Sudden increase in caloric intake",
        "Choice 4": "Big change in diabetic medication use",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Standard diabetic therapy includes diet, hypoglycemic agents, and exercise. If one aspect of the therapy changes, then the other two aspects must be adjusted to avoid hyperglycemia. Improving glucose metabolism is a huge benefit of exercise for the person with diabetes. In all people, exercise helps maintain aerobic conditioning, stabilizes mood, improves the quality of sleep, and is especially important for those with diabetes to promote and maintain collateral circulation. For this resident, a slow decline in physical activity will necessitate a change in the amount of insulin given or the total amount of daily calories to prevent hyperglycemia; however, the best solution for this resident is to increase daily physical activity. A new event is likely to cause an abrupt change in the serum glucose. Although infections are frequently detected in an individual with diabetes, infections are more closely associated with sudden-onset hyperglycemia. A sudden increase in caloric intake is likely to cause a sudden increase in blood glucose. A big change in medication use is likely to cause an abrupt change in the serum glucose."

Which exercise safety tip from EASY calls for the nurse to assess the resident before planning care?",
        "Choice 1": "Do not exercise a red, warm, or swollen joint.",
        "Choice 2": "Avoid stretches that cause you to bend at the waist.",

        "Choice 4": "Begin by warming up with low-to-moderate exercises.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The nurse needs more information because the reason the resident’s height has decreased is not known. Therefore to obtain the information, the nurse decides to complete a resident assessment before planning an exercise program. The shrinkage can be due to atrophy of intervertebral discs, compression fractures, or changes in the curvature of the spine, any of which can be aggravated by incorrectly exercising. With a complete assessment, however, the nurse can plan a suitable exercise program for the resident. Red, warm, swollen joints are usually due to gout or rheumatoid arthritis; fortunately, the resident does not have these health problems. However, this is a good recommendation for anyone who exercises. Evaluating an individual’s surroundings when exercising does not alert the nurse who is considering an exercise plan for this resident; however, this is a good, general recommendation for anyone who exercises. Warming up with low-to-moderate exercises is a good recommendation for anyone who exercises."

        "Explanation": "The nurse should recommend endurance exercises for the group to improve cardiovascular and respiratory conditioning. Endurance training is suitable to prepare the residents to withstand the rigors of travel. Standing on one foot for 30 seconds is a reasonable exercise to recommend because balance tends to decrease with age; however, the cornerstone of the group’s exercise must be endurance. Moving light weights is also a reasonable exercise to recommend because muscle bulk tends to decrease with age; however, the cornerstone of the group’s exercise must be endurance.

        "Explanation": "The most important nursing intervention when an older adult is positioned on the side is to relieve pressure on the head of the femur and the greater trochanter; the greater trochanter is the most prominent bony projection on the side of a body. By turning the older adult at intervals, the nurse helps maintain tissue perfusion, thus providing oxygenation to tissues and allowing the removal of waste from vulnerable skin. The nurse places a pillow between the knees to help maintain physiological body alignment and to prevent strain on the hips and spine; if positioned properly, the pillow can help maintain tissue integrity of the medial malleolus and ankle by elevating them off the mattress. However, because the nurse’s priority is to maintain tissue oxygenation, preventing muscle and joint strain is not as important. The nurse keeps the skin clean and dry to help maintain skin integrity, but this intervention is not as important as maintaining tissue oxygenation. The nurse uses the Sims’ position to supplement turning; when in the Sims’ position, the patient is on the side but rotated slightly forward, allowing the chest and abdomen to fall forward to relieve some of the pressure on the patient’s side."

        "Explanation": "Orange slices provide vitamin C, which is important for healthy tissues and gums, tissue repair and healing, and the maintenance of blood vessels. Although carrots sticks are a good source of beta carotene, fiber, and vitamin A and important in the formation of epithelial tissue and although milk provides calcium for bone strength and protein for tissue repair, neither carrots nor milk address vitamin deficiency. Unsalted nuts provide healthy fats, fiber, and other nutrients but not vitamin C."

        "Explanation": "The nurse is alert for rough, dry, flaky skin when an older adult complains of pruritus to be able to prevent linear excoriation leading to skin breaks, excoriation, inflammation, and infection. A brown macule is a freckle or a liver spot, an indication of sun exposure. Brownish skin is a clinical indicator of venous insufficiency. Regional edema is a sign of fluid overload and venous insufficiency; localized edema is a sign of infection."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Herpes zoster in an adult is spread through contact; therefore the nurse applies the principles of contact precautions when caring for an older adult with active herpes zoster. To reduce the transmission of the virus through contact, the nurse keeps the ruptured lesions covered. A face shield is not necessary when caring for an adult with herpes zoster; however, a gown can be necessary during dressing changes or any time that splashing can occur. Airborne precautions and a respirator-type mask are indicated for infections transmitted through the air. Because active herpes zoster in an older adult is transmitted through contact, negative airflow is not indicated."

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Fungal infections are most likely to begin in moist, dark areas of the body such as under the breasts and at the perineum; thus the nurse works to keep the skin of these areas, as well as all skin, clean and dry and to prevent tissue irritation from harsh drying. Providing oral care with a soft-bristled brush is ineffective therapy for preventing an oral Candida infection (thrush). Besides, thrush is usually an opportunistic infection caused by immunosuppression. Reddened tissue can be already infected; nonetheless, applying an antifungal agent is an indicated treatment for a fungal infection. Applying antifungal lotion and keeping an area moist can contribute to fungal overgrowth."

        "Explanation": "One area of concern the  nurse should address is the potential for skin breakdown related to possible pain or immobility due to arthritic changes. The nurse also plans care to address dehydration as a significant risk factor for pressure ulcers because this man is underweight, malnourished, and dehydrated as evidenced by dry mucous membranes. Dehydration increases the risk for pressure ulcers because water is essential for intracellular functioning and cell durability.

Restraints have not been shown to increase safety and may contribute to morbidity and mortality. Even if a fall does not cause injury, it can contribute to the fear of falling, inhibiting activities of daily living.

Cane tips should be flat on the bottom with a series of rings, not smooth. Older adults are tempted to save money by using assistive devices from nonmedical sources; however, regardless of the source of the assistive device, the device should be fitted to the older adult.

However, in an attempt to communicate the fall risk to other staff members, the nurse failed to communicate properly to the patient about fall prevention before leaving the room. Calling for someone to bring the sign would have been a reasonable approach to communicating the risk of falls, but it does not take the place of directly instructing the patient about prevention. The needs of an older adult can contribute to the risk of falls as an individual leans and reaches for something; therefore call bell instructions are a reasonable approach for preventing falls. However, before providing the call bell instructions, the nurse needed to tell him to call for help. A urinal and drinking water are common items that an older man needs, but reaching for them can contribute to falls."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Older adults are at higher risk of hypothermia in the community because hypothermia is difficult to detect and because, as hypothermia sets in, the older adult can respond to a lower temperature. This man has clinical indicators of hypothermia; therefore the home care nurse first assesses the ambient temperature for a baseline determination because the household temperature should have the most profound impact on his body temperature. Asking about shivering can be ineffective with an older adult who is confused and disoriented; the response can be incorrect. However, to display respect, the nurse should ask the question. The type of food preparation can offer additional clues about the older adult’s hypothermia and mental status; if he is eating cold foods such as sandwiches and yogurt, then he can be unwittingly contributing to the problem. Presence of radon in the home may lead to lung cancer, not confusion."

        "Explanation": "The AGS states that group exercises can be effective to improve balance as part of a fall prevention program for older adults. Using an assistive device can help prevent falls; however, assistive devices are not part of an exercise program. Although the AGS states that the relationship between exercise and reducing the risk for falls is strong, the recommended type, duration, and intensity of the exercises are not clear. The AGS states that to improve balance with exercise, an older adult must participate in exercise for at least 10 weeks."

        "Question": "The nurse is discharging an older woman who uses a walker from rehabilitative care. Which observation does the nurse use to determine whether the patient is prepared for discharge?",
        "Choice 1": "She holds the front of the walker.",
        "Choice 2": "She has a walker with four wheels.",
        "Choice 3": "She takes four steps into the walker.",
        "Choice 4": "She takes the walker to the elevator.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The older adult uses the elevator to travel between floors of a building, demonstrating that she knows not to use a walker on the stairs and is thus safe to discharge. Older adults should use the arms of a walker for stability. A walker with four wheels can be easy to move; however, such ease of movement does not provide enough stability to be suitable as an assistive device. To use a walker correctly, she should take two steps at a time into the walker."

        "Question": "The nurse plans care to prevent a dangerous thermal environment for an older man who lives in a northern climate of the United States. Which patient assessment data does the nurse recognize that can contribute to his risk of hypothermia? (Select all that apply.)",
        "Choice 1": "Has a history of a cerebrovascular accident (CVA)",
        "Choice 2": "Has a history of diabetes mellitus",
        "Choice 3": "Builds miniature cars for a hobby",
        "Choice 4": "Bathes three to four times a week",
        "Choice 5": "Gets heat from a boiler in the cellar",
        "Choice 6": "Becomes diaphoretic on warm days",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 2, 3, 5",
        "Explanation": "A CVA can impair an older adult’s thermoregulatory center and potentially diminish the individual’s awareness of temperature changes or the ability to respond suitably to a temperature change. In addition, if the older adult is left with a cognitive deficit or aphasia, then the older adult’s ability to communicate a thermal problem is potentially impaired. A history of diabetes mellitus can contribute to a dangerous thermal environment for the older adult. A complication of diabetes is peripheral neuropathy, which potentially impairs the ability to sense temperature change. In addition, peripheral arterial disease associated with diabetes contributes to the individual’s ability to compensate to temperature changes with vasodilation or vasoconstriction. Building miniature cars is a sedentary activity. The associated metabolic activity is low, the older adult generates less heat from metabolic activity, and the individual is at a higher risk for hypothermia when the temperature is cool. Household heat from a boiler in the cellar creates a potential regulatory problem for the older adult living in the building because adjustments to temperature affect the entire household and are only made in the cellar. Thermostats in individual rooms do not exist in such a heating system. If the individual has impaired mobility, then he might be unable to navigate the stairs to the cellar and adjust the temperature. Bathing three to four times a week limits the exposure of bare skin to the cooling effects of evaporation to reduce the risk of hypothermia. Diaphoresis on a warm day is a suitable response to heat."

The nurse examines flexibility, muscle strength, vital signs, and other clinical indicators in the physical assessment of an older adult to plan individualized fall prevention measures. The nurse uses information about gait, balance, and ability to perform activities of daily living in the functional status assessment of an older adult to plan individualized fall prevention measures. The nurse examines medications, previous accidents and falls, co-morbid conditions, and other factors in the historical assessment of an older adult to plan individualized fall prevention measures.

Chronic illnesses are long-term problems, and cures are not usually available. If a patient has an incurable illness, then the nurse can provide a caring environment to facilitate the implementation of the patient and family’s wishes.

        "Explanation": "A patient with a severe stroke, for example, may not be able to walk again but may recover mobility by learning to drive a motorized wheelchair. The purpose of rehabilitation is to enable the person to regain function but not necessarily specific abilities, which can involve the development of compensating abilities (e.g., motorized chair driving) rather than the recovery of original abilities (e.g., walking).

        "Explanation": "Chronic pain is more likely to cause depression than osteoporosis. This woman has no predictive indicators for a peripheral neuropathy. A hip fracture from the greater to the lesser trochanter because of osteoporosis is the most likely acute condition this older adult will face, because osteoporosis commonly attacks long bones and the proximal end of the femur, in particular. As a result, the older woman is more likely to fracture her hip and then fall than she is to fall and then fracture her hip.

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The dominant arm, vital to the skill of a carpenter, is useless to this man unless he can adapt to the impairment with adaptive skills. Collaborating with OT is the most important goal for this older adult because adaptation is the greatest factor in establishing wellness, and OT can assist this man with adaptive tools, skills, and abilities to manage living with a flaccid dominant hand and arm. Maintaining skin integrity should be included in this man’s plan of care because a flaccid extremity is at risk for skin breakdown, but it is not the first priority. Promoting plaque-reversing strategies, including diet and antilipid medication, should be part of this man’s plan of care. However, these strategies are not the most important goal for this man; adaptation is the most important factor in establishing health and wellness. Supporting effective coping mechanisms is a goal that should be included in this man’s plan of care; however, given the flaccidity of his dominant arm, the most effective measures toward adaptation are to help him develop the new skills and abilities he will need to cope effectively. Supporting effective coping mechanisms can help enhance the work of OT."

        "Explanation": "With no clues about the cause of the fatigue, the nurse helps this older adult balance exercise and rest to help alleviate fatigue. The fatigue can be due to decreased physical activity that, in turn, is due to pain from the OA, in which case a balance of exercise and rest should help attenuate the effects of the pain from the OA. This older adult has no indicators of depression except for fatigue.

        "Answer": "1, 2, 4, 6",
        "Explanation": "An older adult with myasthenia gravis has a chronic, progressive disorder characterized by muscle weakness, especially after exercise. Crises can develop as a myasthenic crisis, characterized by severe, generalized, muscle weakness with life-threatening consequences, or a cholinergic crisis, generally caused by an excessive dose of medication and characterized by excessive salivation and lacrimation, tachycardia, and diarrhea. The nurse recognizes the cognitive function to manage his finances successfully as a potential for self-care of his condition and can use this potential ability to plan care in the disability assessment. Living in an adult community implies independent living and some ability to perform self-care activities. Skilled nursing services in the home must be necessary to have Medicare health coverage; therefore if this patient requires assistance with activities of daily living, then he must depend on his wife or another resource. Living with another adult can be an asset. For this man, his wife identifies an area of a needed self-care resource because, although she can be trained to identify deteriorating muscle strength in this man, her ability to manage a crisis effectively is impaired with poor eyesight. Thus, the nurse uses the gap between his cognitive function and the wife’s ability to manage a crisis to plan his nursing care."

        "Question": "The nurse admits an older man who had abdominal surgery. Admission vital signs are heart rate (pulse) (P), 73 beats per minute (bpm); respiration rate (R), 20 breaths per minute; blood pressure (BP), 136/84 mm Hg. He is receiving intravenous (IV) fluids but has not requested pain medication since surgery. Seven hours later, his vital signs are P, 98 bpm; R, 26 breaths per minute; and BP, 164/90 mm Hg; and he denies pain. Which intervention should the nurse implement?",
        "Choice 1": "Administer an opioid medication by IV route.",
        "Choice 2": "Check the surgical dressing for bleeding.",
        "Choice 3": "Report the vital signs to the health care provider.",
        "Choice 4": "Ask if he has about discomfort at the surgical site or any other location.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The patient’s P, R, and BP increased significantly since his admitting vital signs and indicate the potential for pain or discomfort from the surgical incision. The older adult patient may also be experiencing pain unrelated to the surgery due to arthritic changes, neuropathies, etc. The patient can be misunderstanding the nurse’s question or be barred from saying, “yes,” by cultural patterns. Such miscommunication is common; therefore the nurse rewords the question using another term for pain such as discomfort, burning, or pressure. Administering an opioid medication by IV route is unethical without the patient’s request. When checking the surgical dressing for bleeding, the patient may show signs of pain rather than blood loss. Reporting the vital signs to the health care provider would be premature; the patient’s pain assessment is not complete."

        "Question": "An older woman had hip replacement surgery 1 day ago, and the nurse thinks that the woman also has dementia. Which patient assessment does the nurse use to determine whether this woman is experiencing pain?",
        "Choice 1": "Holds abdomen tightly.",
        "Choice 2": "Is not verbalizing.",
        "Choice 3": "Has stable vital signs.",
        "Choice 4": "Moves during sleep.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Because this older adult has a potential cognitive impairment and is likely to self-report pain unreliably, the nurse uses additional clinical indicators to detect pain. Muscle rigidity and guarding are clinical indicators of pain for a postoperative older adult, regardless of a cognitive impairment. An individual experiencing pain is unlikely to have stable vital signs. Not verbalizing can indicate a sensory impairment and warrants further investigation by the nurse. Nonetheless, this older adult’s verbalizations are potentially unreliable indicators of pain. Older adults move normally during sleep to adjust their position in bed; moving during sleep is not an indicator of pain unless the movements are agitated or restless in nature."

        "Question": "The safest opioid analgesic choice for an older patient who has severe acute pain is which of the following?",
        "Choice 1": "Meperidine (Demerol)",
        "Choice 2": "Morphine sulfate (Morphine)",
        "Choice 3": "Pentazocine (Talwin)",
        "Choice 4": "Safe opioids do not exist.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Morphine sulfate (Morphine), oxycodone (Oxycontin), hydrocodone (Hycodan), hydromorphone (Dilaudid), and fentanyl (Sublimaze) are opioids that can be safely used with older patients. Meperidine and pentazocine are both contraindicated for older adults because their metabolites can produce confusion, psychotic behavior, and seizures. Used properly, opioids have a lower risk of certain side effects than nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents (NSAIDs)."

        "Choice 1": "Opioids are less effective in older patients than in younger patients.",
        "Choice 2": "Stool softeners and laxatives should be used with opioids.",
        "Choice 3": "Over-the-counter NSAIDs are generally harmless.",
        "Choice 4": "The dose limit for acetaminophen is difficult to reach for older adults.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Opioids often cause constipation and necessitate bowel stimulation to prevent constipation. A bowel regimen should be instituted at the same time as opioid treatment. Because of changes in metabolism with aging, opioids have a greater and longer-lasting analgesic effect in older patients. NSAIDs can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, kidney and liver damage, and drug interactions with potentially fatal results. The maximum daily dose of acetaminophen is 4000 mg, and the limit is lower for patients with kidney or liver failure and patients who use alcohol. A typical dose is two 500-mg (“extra-strength”) tablets."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Acupuncture is a nonpharmacological treatment that helps reduce the perception of pain. An adjuvant is a medication that has been developed for a different purpose but serves to alter the perception of pain, possibly in combination with a pain medication. Lidocaine patches are a pharmacological treatment for pain relief. Capsaicin is a pharmacological means of providing comfort and alleviating pain and distress."

        "Question": "An older adult admitted for back surgery asks for opioid pain medication. The nurse knows the patient asks for pain medication 15 minutes before it is due. Which recommendation should the nurse implement?",
        "Choice 1": "Validate the pain with other assessment data.",
        "Choice 2": "Administer the pain medication as requested by the patient.",
        "Choice 3": "Tell the patient that it is too soon for pain medication.",
        "Choice 4": "Teach the patient alternative comfort measures.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The nurse should administer the opioid pain medication as requested because the patient is asking for the pain medication within the prescription’s time limit. Most institutions allow the nurse to administer opioid medications 15 to 30 minutes before the designated time on the prescription; therefore the patient is not asking for the medication too early. In addition, the nurse has an obligation to the patient to administer the pain medication; not doing so violates the patient’s rights. The nurse can rely on the patient’s report to determine the need for pain medication. As long as the timing is suitable and the patient is stable, the nurse should administer the medication."

        "Choice 1": "Place side rails up x 4.",
        "Choice 2": "Position the patient comfortably.",
        "Choice 3": "Offer toileting and a sip of water.",
        "Choice 4": "Instruct him to ask for help before getting up.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The most important intervention for fall and injury prevention is for the nurse to instruct the older adult to ask for help before getting up after receiving an opioid medication. This intervention is important because the medication can cause sedation and dizziness; therefore the nurse instructs him to ask for help to prevent a fall or injury. Side rails up x 4 is considered a restraint and may place the patient at risk for injury. Comfortable positioning is also a good supplemental intervention after administering pain medication. Offering toileting and hydration is a reasonable intervention to implement after administering pain medication, but it does not offer the same degree of safety as instructing the patient to call for help."

        "Choice 1": "Have many illnesses.",
        "Choice 2": "Experience more loss.",
        "Choice 3": "Possess fewer assets.",
        "Choice 4": "Live with impairments.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Older adults are at higher risk for acute psychological pain than younger adults because they experience more loss such as the pain occurring in early bereavement or in a major depressive episode. Older adults tend to have more illnesses than younger adults, and illness can trigger depression. The lack of assets of younger and older adults is unlikely to be related to acute psychological distress unless a sudden loss of a large asset is experienced. Older adults do not necessarily live with impairments. Further, if impairment causes psychological distress, then the acute phase is likely to occur at the onset rather than in day-to-day activities."

        "Choice 1": "Encourage the patient to keep his leg elevated.",
        "Choice 2": "Instruct him to rest until the pain disappears.",
        "Choice 3": "Suggest taking pain medication before walking.",
        "Choice 4": "Collaborate with the health care provider to make a walker available.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The nurse suggests taking the pain medication before walking to provide relief during the time when the pain occurs. In addition, if the patient premedicates, then the analgesic effect is likely to last long enough to benefit the patient for any pain after walking. Elevating leg will provide comfort and decrease in edema after exercise; however inactivity may exacerbate the pain. Inactivity tends to exacerbate the pain of OA. Instead, the nurse recommends a balance of rest and exercise. A walker is not indicated and will not alleviate any pain in the knees; it is intended to provide stability for ambulation."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Postherpetic neuralgia tends to persist in the dermatome of a spinal nerve. For example, postherpetic neuralgia of C8 (the 8th cervical spinal nerve) should cause burning, itching, or stinging pain along the back of one arm, through the elbow, and down to the smallest finger on the side of the same hand. Persistent pain does not occur along a well-defined path. Osteoarthritic pain is usually persistent but seldom occurs along a well-defined path; the pain is usually localized. Postoperative pain is acute pain that occurs in the area of the surgical procedure and incision."

        "Choice 1": "Numeric Rating Scale",
        "Choice 2": "Verbal Descriptor Scale",
        "Choice 3": "Iowa Pain Thermometer",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Hispanic men are less likely to report pain because their culture tells them to deny and withstand pain without complaining. The nurse uses the FPS-R to validate the patient’s report because the postoperative period in knee replacement surgery is very painful; this fact makes the nurse think that the patient is likely to have pain. The HIGN has data that support the claim that Hispanic and African-American older adults prefer using the FPS-R for evaluating pain. The Numeric Rating Scale, the Verbal Descriptor Scale, and the Iowa Pain Thermometer are valid and reliable assessment tools, but older Hispanic adults prefer using the FPS-R."

Which of the following would be most helpful for the nurse to use to identify the relationships between the comfort measures, activity, and pharmacotherapy, and the older adult’s pain level?",
        "Choice 1": "Older adult’s self-report",
        "Choice 2": "FPS-R",
        "Choice 3": "Older adult’s pain diary",
        "Choice 4": "Pain medication frequency",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The nurse instructs the older adult to maintain a pain diary to help the individual achieve some control over the pain experience. The diary is then used to identify trends or the timing of pain and the relationships between the patient’s pain level and the comfort measures, activity, and pain medications. Many older adults report feeling useful and having some control over the pain, or at least the pain management program, through maintaining a pain diary. Self-reporting is one parameter used to evaluate pain, but drawing a relationship between the pain level and other factors is still necessary. The FPS-R is a reliable pain assessment tool, but the task remains to link the pain rating to other factors. The frequency of medication administration provides a clue about the patient’s pain level."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "2, 5, 6",
        "Explanation": "Bone metastasis is likely to cause an older adult chronic pain because it is extremely difficult to eradicate cancer metastasis from bone. In addition, the invasion of cancer into bone can be very painful as a result of tumor growth pressing on nerves. Compression fractures are likely to cause chronic pain because the compressed vertebra is likely to press on spinal nerves, causing muscle spasms. Postherpetic neuralgia is a result of nerve damage from shingles and is likely to cause chronic pain; it is very difficult to treat effectively. A hip replacement is performed to relieve chronic pain or to repair a fracture and is more likely to cause acute pain. Hypoproteinemia is unlikely to cause chronic pain but is more likely to cause fatigue. A migraine headache is likely to cause acute, intense pain. Although headaches can be recurrent, they are usually time limited."

Presbyopia, a gradual decline in the flexibility of the lens, makes close-up focusing more difficult and is a common age-related change but not a disease.

Aphasia has the potential to affect the individual’s life; however, with adequate vision, some means of communication can remain viable. Glaucoma would not devastate the individual’s ability to read sign language unless blindness occurred. Effective treatment should help maintain the individual’s baseline visual acuity. Osteoarthritis can make signing more difficult for an individual with prelingual deafness, but it is not nearly as devastating to the ability to communicate as a cloudy lens from cataracts."

        "Choice 4": "Use white noise to override the tinnitus.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The nurse assesses the patient for risk factors potentially contributing to tinnitus that can be altered such as smoking cigarettes, consuming caffeine, drinking alcohol, experiencing fatigue, and taking medications that carry a high risk of causing tinnitus. Removing these potential offenders can help give the patient a sense of control, as well as provide potential relief from tinnitus. The nurse irrigates the external auditory canal for impacted cerumen to decrease the risk of tinnitus.. Although a hearing aid and a masker have the potential to alleviate tinnitus, introducing them can also serve as a potential source of additional stress, depending on the financial and functional status of the individual. Although white noise has the potential to alleviate tinnitus, it can be ineffective or serve as a potential source of additional stress."

        "Explanation": "A fasting plasma glucose reading of over 125 mg/dl is considered diabetes, whereas a level between 110 mg/dl and 125 mg/dl is considered to be impaired fasting glucose (IFG). Type 2 diabetes is present when insulin is produced but does not lower the blood glucose level. Type 1 diabetes was formerly called insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, whereas type 2 diabetes was formerly called non–insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Broccoli does not raise blood glucose levels. White bread quickly breaks down to glucose and therefore tends to cause a rapid, brief rise in the blood sugar level. Whole grains provide a more sustained release of glucose and are a better source of carbohydrates. The blood glucose level increases after eating baked beans, but the rise will occur more slowly, reaching a lower level of hyperglycemia and remaining for a longer period. Corn is a starchy vegetable and will raise the blood glucose level almost as much as sugar itself."

The use of sitagliptin (Januvia), a dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitor, is indicated for type 2 diabetes mellitus and acts by improving glucose-dependent insulin synthesis, lowering glucagon secretion and slowing gastric emptying. Metformin (Glucophage) acts by decreasing the release of glucose from the liver. Thiazolidinediones, such as rosiglitazone (Avandia), act by enhancing insulin sensitivity with hepatic glucose metabolism and by enhancing insulin-receptor kinase activity and phosphorylation."

        "Choice 1": "Wear well-fitting, leather shoes",
        "Choice 2": "Wear knee-high nylon stockings",
        "Choice 3": "Soak the feet in warm water",
        "Choice 4": "Apply antifungal powder on the feet",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The older adult is potentially experiencing a peripheral neuropathy from peripheral nerve damage from hyperglycemia. To prevent trauma to the feet, the nurse instructs him to wear comfortable, well-fitting, tie-on shoes with a broad toe space and low heels for protection. Nylon stockings for men tend to have restrictive ends that can inhibit tissue perfusion; because this patient is at risk for peripheral tissue damage, the constricted area can break down. The nurse also instructs him to avoid sitting with one leg crossed over the other or with both legs crossed at the knee; these positions restrict blood flow to the feet. Foot soaks can potentially cause excessive dryness. To maintain skin integrity, feet should be washed daily but not soaked. Irritating chemicals such as antifungal powder and corn or wart preparations should not be used on the feet of individuals with diabetes."

Which one of the following interventions is the best for the nurse to implement?",
        "Choice 1": "Ask the patient if she has had a fever or infection recently.",
        "Choice 2": "Verify the expiration date of the medication.",
        "Choice 3": "Review her diet for increased carbohydrates.",
        "Choice 4": "Ascertain whether the vaginal cream contains estrogen.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Vaginal cream prescribed for hot flashes potentially contains estrogen as an active ingredient; estrogen is effective therapy to reduce hot flashes. Unfortunately, estrogen impairs the hypoglycemic effect of sulfonylurea hypoglycemic medications. If the estrogen therapy continues, then the nurse should assist this individual in adjusting her diet and exercise regimen in coordination with her antidiabetic medication to maintain stable blood sugar levels. Asking whether she has had a fever or infection recently is a reasonable question because infection increases the blood sugar of an individual with diabetes mellitus; however, because the hyperglycemia is associated with the vaginal cream, the most likely contributor to the problem is the vaginal cream, which is a good place to start the investigation. Verifying the expiration date of the medication is a reasonable task to implement; however, ineffective medication would not have the desired hypoglycemic effect. Reviewing her diet for increased carbohydrates is a reasonable task to implement because a glucose load will increase blood sugar levels."

        "Explanation": "The nurse focuses on the hearing impairment to plan care for stabilizing this patient’s blood glucose level; hearing impairment is a factor that affects blood glucose control in older adults with diabetes mellitus. Reading glasses at 2.0 are medium-strength glasses, and the need for such glasses is common and not considered a visual impairment. A preference for spicy food does not indicate an impaired sense of taste. Although numbness is a sensory impairment, episodic numbness associated with sleeping is more likely to be due to a poorly positioned extremity."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The Hgb A1c is an indicator of serum glucose control over the last 90 days. A Hgb A1c level over 8% indicates that this older adult had poor glucose control in that time frame. As a reliable indicator of hyperglycemia, it can indicate the reason this man experiences erectile dysfunction; hyperglycemia is associated with peripheral arterial disease. An erection occurs as the penile shaft becomes engorged with blood. This process can be impaired if the vessels are damaged from hyperglycemia because hyperglycemia damages the lining of blood vessels and leads to progressive occlusion of the damaged vessels. Many of the vessels involved in causing an erection are fine vessels and are among the first vessels occluded in arterial disease. The potassium level, the prothrombin time, and the ALT are all within normal limits."

        "Choice 4": "Prepare to administer insulin.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Diabetes mellitus is controlled by balancing exercise, calories, and hypoglycemic medication; if one element of therapy is altered, then one or both of the remaining elements must be adjusted. When the patient’s activity is going to metabolize more calories, the medication has to be reduced or the calories have to increase. For a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus, adjusting the medication can be difficult; therefore the nurse instructs this older adult to supplement his caloric intake, which can be accomplished by eating snacks during the walk or by increasing the glycemic load before walking. The patient ensures glucose control during these activities by testing his blood sugar levels. The nurse cannot tell the patient to omit medication because doing so is not within a nurse’s scope of practice. The nurse instructs the older adult to wear closed, well-fitting leather shoes to protect the feet from trauma. Although many individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus periodically take insulin, insulin is administered to induce hypoglycemia. Because the individual plans to walk more than usual, more calories are needed to prevent hypoglycemia."

Weakness is a clinical indicator of moderate hypoglycemia and is unlikely to be masked by the effects of metoprolol. Impaired vision is a clinical indicator of moderate hypoglycemia and is unlikely to be masked by the effects of metoprolol. Shaking is an early clinical indicator of hypoglycemia and likely to be masked by the action of a beta-adrenergic blocker such as metoprolol; beta-blockers oppose the surge of epinephrine in early hypoglycemia. Diaphoresis is an early clinical indicator of hypoglycemia, and it is likely to be masked by the action of a beta-adrenergic blocker such as metoprolol.

RA strikes the same parts of the body on both sides and affects joints in a symmetrical pattern. Patients with RA can have remissions and exacerbations. Unlike OA, however, RA has a highly variable course, which may include remissions, as well as exacerbations. RA can affect body systems other than joints and can cause general fatigue and malaise and attack systems other than joints. Glucosamine can be helpful for patients in the first 2 years of RA.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Only 40% of people who have an OA-related fracture recuperate to their prefall mobility status; therefore the most important goal for the nurse is to plan care designed to restore her baseline mobility status. This comprehensive goal encompasses nutrition, exercise, rest, and physical therapy and prevents postoperative complications, such as atelectasis and pneumonia, impaired skin integrity, constipation, and dehydration, which can plague older adults. Increasing dietary fiber and nutrient-dense foods is an intervention to help maintain regular bowel habits and to repair and build tissue; it is integral to postoperative and rehabilitative care for an older adult but is not the highest priority. Preventing infection and promoting skin integrity are integral to postoperative and rehabilitative care for an older adult. Instructing the older adult about properly using a walker is an intervention and part of the primary goal of restoring preoperative mobility."

        "Question": "An older woman seeks advice from the nurse about preventing further bone loss after being diagnosed with osteopenia. To achieve the woman’s goal, which of the following patient teachings should the nurse provide to enhance the activity of the osteoblasts?",
        "Choice 1": "Limit sodium intake.",
        "Choice 2": "Eat high-fiber foods.",
        "Choice 3": "Refrain from alcohol use.",
        "Choice 4": "Exercise with weights.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "In osteopenia, bone metabolism is unbalanced because the action of osteoclasts is greater than the action of osteoblasts. To treat osteopenia effectively, the balance between the activities of the bone cells must be shifted to more osteoblast (bone-building) activity; increasing osteoblast activity helps reduce bone loss and, at the same time, helps gain bone density. Lifting weights stimulates osteoblasts to build bone through the application of opposing forces on the bone and helps achieve the woman’s goal by increasing physical activity (to stem bone loss) and by generating more bone (to gain bone density). Sodium impairs calcium absorption; therefore the nurse instructs her to limit sodium intake to reduce bone loss. Alcohol impairs calcium absorption; therefore the nurse instructs her to avoid alcoholic beverages. Fiber inhibits calcium absorption."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Reviewing the older adult’s nutritional habits can reveal clues about potential dietary contributors to bone loss from excessive sodium, alcohol, caffeine, or carbonated beverage intake. In addition, the nurse also confirms that the patient avoids smoking and a sedentary lifestyle that contribute to bone loss. Tai chi or yoga, drinking fortified milk, and increasing weight-bearing exercises can all help increase bone density."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The joint of an older adult with OA is narrower than a normal joint, and as the disease advances, crepitus is palpable over the joint. The joint narrows as it degenerates, and crepitus occurs as the articulating surfaces of the bone abnormally move against each other. Disease in symmetrical joints is characteristic of RA. Morning stiffness lasting for 1 hour or more is characteristic of polymyalgia rheumatica. Swelling from excessive synovial fluid is characteristic of RA."

        "Choice 4": "Avoid stretching the affected joint during exercise.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "As OA progresses, the joint deteriorates and can become unstable, thereby increasing the risk of falls. The joint stability will not improve without physical therapy or surgery; therefore the patient needs to report instability to the health care provider. Although ibuprofen is much less likely to cause dizziness, hypotension, or sedation, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents such as ibuprofen are poor analgesic choices for older adults; they can aggravate hypertension and impair renal blood flow. The nurse avoids recommending increased rest because rest contributes to stiffness. Stretching is an important form of exercise for older adults with OA; it helps maintain joint flexibility and range of motion."

        "Choice 1": "Assess her joints for swelling and redness.",
        "Choice 2": "Obtain blood specimens for blood cultures.",

        "Choice 4": "Tell her to apply moist heat for 20 minutes.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The older adult exhibits clinical indicators of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), and a serious complication of PMR is giant cell arteritis (GCA). The nurse instructs the patient to report scalp and temporal pain because they are early indicators of GCA. As a complication of PMR, the patient exhibits clinical indicators of PMR that include severe pain and stiffness of muscles, including the back, buttocks, and thighs. PMR is not a disease that affects the joints. Blood cultures are not indicated for PMR because it is not an infection. Because PMR is an autoimmune, inflammatory disorder, applying heat is more likely to aggravate the patient’s condition. Effective treatment for PMR includes low-dose steroids. However, low-dose steroids are unrelated to preventing complications of PMR."

        "Explanation": "OA is not a systemic disease, nor does it affect joints symmetrically. Myalgia and stiffness are characteristics of PMR; however, myalgia is uncharacteristic of RA and OA. Joint pain is characteristic of both RA and OA, but only OA is curable through joint replacement. RA is a systemic disease and affects joints symmetrically; therefore these are clinical indicators of OA, not RA."

        "Choice 4": "Avoid game meat, asparagus, and alcohol.",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 2, 4",
        "Explanation": "Because this individual exhibits an acute attack in the ankle from hyperuricemia, the goal of therapy is to prevent another attack. To decrease uric acid production, the prophylactic medication of choice for gouty arthritis is colchicine (Colsalide). To enhance the action of this medication and to further reduce this patient’s risk of another attack, the nurse instructs the patient to avoid game meat and asparagus, because they contain purine, and to avoid alcohol, because it increases uric acid production. The nurse instructs the patient to drink 2 liters of water daily to facilitate uric acid excretion and to prevent the crystallization of uric acid in the renal tubules. The nurse also instructs this individual to avoid aspirin because it increases the risk of an acute attack and counteracts the benefit of uric acid prophylaxis. Antihypertensive therapy helps reduce the risk of another attack, but when diuretic agents are used for antihypertensive therapy, the potential benefit for gout prophylaxis is blunted because diuretics increase the risk of gouty attacks."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "3, 5",
        "Explanation": "Participating in a regular exercise program is an important nursing intervention to help prevent the risk of falls for this older adult who has clinical indicators of complications from steroid therapy. Steroids are a common therapeutic regimen used during exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). When needed on a long-term basis, steroids can ravage the skin and the musculoskeletal system of the patient, causing muscle wasting and OA. Thus this man is likely to have below-normal bone density; therefore the nurse instructs him to participate in regular, progressive exercises and pulmonary rehabilitation to build cardiopulmonary reserve, muscle bulk, and bone density to help reduce the risk of falls. The nurse also instructs the patient to eat a high-calorie, well-balanced diet to provide the body with substrate for tissue building and repair. A higher amount of calories than usual are required because patients with COPD work hard to breathe, and this work requires more calories to prevent tissue atrophy. A well-balanced diet helps prevent the risk of falls by supplying the body with sufficient fuel to sustain activity and by increasing bone and muscle density to maintain balance and coordinated movement. Although this man is at risk for below-normal bone density, the nurse instructs the patient to take up to 500 mg of calcium because the system cannot absorb more than 500 mg at a time. To protect the gastrointestinal tract, administering a proton-pump inhibitor is a reasonable nursing intervention for a patient with a history of taking steroids; however, this intervention is not directly related to reducing the risk of falls. Avoiding sick people is a reasonable nursing intervention to prevent the risk of infection for an individual with COPD. The nurse instructs this older adult to cleanse the skin gently and to apply an emollient lotion to maintain skin integrity."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Because the heart is an ineffective pump in HF, both excessive urination at night and decreased urination can occur when older adults have an MI. Nocturia occurs in HF when the heart is unable to maintain adequate renal blood flow in the performance of daily activities; then, during the night when the patient’s lower extremities are elevated for sleep, the heart is able to perfuse the kidneys with the assistance of increased venous return owing to the elevated extremities. Inadequate urine production is due to inadequate perfusion from an ineffective pump."

        "Explanation": "During exercise, the body shunts blood to the skeletal muscles to supply enough oxygen to meet the increased metabolic demands of the muscles. If the exercise is suddenly withdrawn, however, the blood temporarily pools in the skeletal muscles, and the older adult loses consciousness from transient hypotension. Baroreceptor responsiveness declines with age; therefore the body does not respond as readily to the need for changes in blood pressure. The cool-down period compensates for this effect."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "A person with COPD can perform self-care tasks if allowed plenty of time to accomplish them and to take breaks for rest. The patient can potentially benefit more from longer periods of exercise supplemented with oxygen than from short excursions without oxygen. A plan to rest in the future after the self-care task of performing ADLs or bathing after eating is accomplished does not compensate for the deprivation of rest when she needs it."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Most reported cases of TB among older adults are from nursing homes. TB is not as contagious as formerly suggested, but drug-resistant forms exist and are a serious risk for older adults who are immunocompromised. A PPD test has a false-negative rate of approximately 30%. When the result is positive, the patient receives a sputum culture and a chest x-ray examination. A positive sputum culture is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Although medications such as isoniazid (INH) were thought to have eliminated TB, the organism is still present in multidrug-resistant forms. Older adults who contracted TB before the 1940s may suffer reactivation of the bacterium."

        "Choice 3": "Nitroglycerin",
        "Choice 4": "Beta-adrenergic blocker",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "A beta-adrenergic blocker is an important part of the standard therapy for patients with HF and is the drug of choice to break the neurohormonal cycle that aggravates HF. Beta-blockers inhibit the action of epinephrine (EPI) and norepinephrine (NE) to decrease myocardial workload and lower the oxygen demands of the myocardial tissue. This woman’s heart is an ineffective pump because it is ischemic and unable to meet the body’s metabolic demands. An ischemic heart has difficulty obtaining the supply of oxygen it needs to maintain cardiac output. As a result, the hypoxic myocardium stimulates the sympathetic nervous system to release EPI and NE for shunting blood from the periphery to vital organs—the fight-or-flight mechanism. The release of EPI and NE causes vasoconstriction and subsequent hypertension. Both make the work of the heart more difficult because the heart must work harder to pump blood out of the left ventricle against a higher afterload. This extra work increases the oxygen demands of the myocardial tissue and augments the cycle started by the ischemic heart."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The most important goal for keeping a patient who has HF out of the hospital is to control total body fluid; hypervolemia aggravates HF by increasing the blood volume and making the heart work harder. Controlling total body fluid also helps prevent dyspnea and hypertension, maintain physical activity, improve rest and sleep, and promote nutrition for optimal health and wellness."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The nurse helps the patient with COPD maintain health and wellness by preventing infection. To accomplish this, the nurse instructs the patient to avoid people with contagious illnesses to reduce exposure to communicable diseases and to wash hands frequently to reduce exposure to microorganisms as potential pathogens. Following these instructions will help the patient avoid hospitalizations for COPD; a pulmonary infection can have a devastating impact on a patient who has compromised pulmonary reserves. Fluid and exudates accumulate in the lungs to decrease oxygenation and ventilation, and the patient with COPD is less able to cough and expel sputum."

        "Explanation": "Carotid stenosis refers to the occlusion of the carotid artery from atherosclerotic plaque and can be a result of chronic hypertension. Older adults with carotid stenosis are at high risk for strokes because of the risk of a thromboembolic event from the plaque. Renal dysfunction can occur as a result of chronic hypertension; the intimal lining of the renal arteries is damaged over time, which leads to renal artery stenosis and decreased renal perfusion. Coronary artery disease is a common result of chronic hypertension."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 3, 4, 6",
        "Explanation": "Standard HF therapy includes taking medications as prescribed with a low-sodium diet to control total body fluids. Usually, dyspnea in a patient with HF is due to hypervolemia, which occurs after a lapse in adherence to the standard HF therapy. The nurse checks the patient’s extremities for edema because peripheral edema is a clinical indicator of hypervolemia. If the patient is nonadherent with therapy, then the nurse is more likely to find peripheral edema than with an adherent patient. Hypervolemia can also be due to worsening HF. The nurse listens to the patient’s lungs to assess for pulmonary edema as a cause for the patient’s dyspnea. Pulmonary edema can be caused by hypervolemia from nonadherence to therapy or from worsening HF. The nurse compares the patient’s weight to his baseline to determine whether the patient has experienced a sudden weight gain, which would be indicative of hypervolemia. Assessing the patient’s diet over the last 48 hours can provide clues about a potential cause of the patient’s dyspnea. If the patient increases the dietary sodium by eating pizza, pickles, and processed food, among others, the patient is likely to experience a sudden increase in total body fluid, which can cause the patient’s dyspnea."

To promote comfort, the gerontological nurse administers medications as prescribed and avoids restricting analgesic agents to patients, regardless of the setting or the nurse’s personal views. Although fostering independence is within the scope of the gerontological nursing practice, the nurse should assess the older adult and family before assuming that he will want or be able to perform self-care.

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The nurse demonstrates leadership in the care of older adults by initiating and coordinating collaboration with the wound care team to improve the health of an older adult. Screening and assessing are only indirectly related to collaboration. In this case, the nurse’s collaborative efforts are unrelated to facilitating access to a program. Thus far, the nurse has not educated or trained this patient in wound care."

        "Question": "Which had a major influence in shifting the care of older adults away from almshouses and public institutions and stimulated the growth of commercial nursing homes?",
        "Choice 1": "Medicare",
        "Choice 2": "Social Security Act",
        "Choice 3": "Hartford Institute for Geriatric Nursing",
        "Choice 4": "Health maintenance organizations (HMOs)",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "With the passage of the Social Security Act of 1935, federal monies were provided for “old-age” insurance and public assistance for needy older people not covered by insurance. To combat the fear of almshouse placement, Congress stipulated that the Social Security funds could not be used to pay for care in almshouses or other public institutions. This move is thought to have been the genesis of commercial nursing homes. During the next 10 years, many almshouses closed, and the number of private boarding homes providing care to older adults increased. Because retired and widowed nurses often converted their homes into such living quarters and gave care when their boarders became ill, they can be considered the first geriatric nurses and their homes to be the first nursing homes. The Hartford Institute has sponsored significant improvements in gerontological nursing practice, research, and education. HMOs have had a significant impact on the management of care but were virtually nonexistent in the 1930s and 1940s."

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The most significant influence in enhancing gerontological nursing has been the work of the Hartford Institute for Geriatric Nursing, funded by the John A. Hartford Foundation. The foundation seeks to shape the quality of the nation’s health care for older Americans by promoting geriatric nursing excellence to both the nursing profession and the larger health care community. Initiatives in nursing education, nursing practice, nursing research, and nursing policy include enhancing geriatrics in nursing education programs through curricular reform and faculty development and the development of nine Centers of Geriatric Nursing Excellence. AARP is a foundation that helps struggling seniors by being a force for change on the most serious issues they face today. Medicare is a national social insurance program, administered by the U.S. federal government since 1965, that guarantees access to health insurance for Americans ages 65 years and older and younger people with disabilities.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The nurse determines when the symptoms first appeared or the time of the fall to determine whether sufficient time is left to administer reperfusion tPA; if indicated, tPA must be administered within 3 hours of symptom onset. A patient with clinical indicators of a stroke will need a computed tomographic (CT) scan to differentiate between a thrombotic stroke and a hemorrhagic stroke; the type of stroke will determine the therapeutic course. The time of symptom onset is a vital piece of information that must be determined before the patient is referred to the radiology department because tPA is usually administered in the radiology suite. Administering tPA can be contraindicated for this patient; therefore the preparation of this infusion is delayed until the type of stroke and the plan of care are determined. The nurse will not have enough time to complete a comprehensive assessment and thus will perform a focused assessment in preparation for the trip to radiology."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Hemorrhagic strokes are primarily caused by uncontrolled hypertension and less often by malformations of the blood vessels (e.g., aneurysms). Although the exact mechanism is not fully understood, it appears that chronic hypertension causes a thickening of the vessel wall, microaneurysms, and necrosis. When enough damage to the vessel accumulates, it is at risk for rupture. The spontaneous rupture may be large and acute or small with a slow leak of blood into the adjacent brain tissue. In many cases, blood ruptures or seeps into the ventricular system of the brain with damage to the affected tissue through necrosis or death of brain tissue."

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Altered cerebral perfusion is the priority diagnosis. Altered cerebral perfusion may be caused by an interruption in blood flow such as occlusive disorder, hemorrhage, cerebral vasospasm, or cerebral edema. It is important for the nurse to monitor cognitive status and vitals for patients experiencing altered cerebral perfusion. The patient is at risk for injury due to the effects of the stroke, however it is not the priority diagnosis. This patient may suffer from altered thought processes due to cerebral damage from the stroke; however, this is not the priority diagnosis.

Pharmacological intervention can be necessary but should not replace careful evaluation and management of the underlying cause. Simply restraining the patient will not address the underlying problem, and the imposition of restraints can trigger delirium. Applying a restraint is the last resort, and the nurse must consider the problems that accompany the application of restraints before doing so.

        "Explanation": "Qualities about the patient’s orientation are a good method for the nurse to use for distinguishing between delirium and depression; in delirium, orientation is usually impaired, and in depression, orientation is normal. Activity can vary throughout the day and is not a good indicator. Delirium tends to be worse at night, and depression tends to be worse in the morning. The nurse avoids using qualities about the patient’s psychomotor activities to distinguish between delirium and depression in an older adult; psychomotor activities in both disorders are highly variable and make distinctions difficult."

        "Question": "A man who is 60 years of age and lives in the British Isles develops dementia. Which qualities of dementia does the nurse assess to prevent patient injury related to the type of dementia this man most likely has?",
        "Choice 1": "Visual hallucinations",

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The nurse assesses the patient for failing memory and incoordination, which are characteristic of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (also known as mad cow disease). This type of dementia began appearing in adults living in the British Isles who reported eating beef from local breeders. The nurse assesses for these qualities because the age of onset is usually around 60 years. This form of dementia progresses rapidly to death; therefore the nurse anticipates that this man will rapidly deteriorate and must be prepared to anticipate changes in motor activities and memory to maintain his safety and to prevent injury."

        "Choice 1": "Assess cognition with MMSE-2.",

        "Choice 3": "Maintain adequate sedation and pain management.",
        "Choice 4": "Cover the patient’s eyes with protective ophthalmic ointment.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Providing uninterrupted periods of rest and sleep is a challenge for the nurse in intensive care. Because of the nature of the patients’ illnesses, nurses administer medications and treatments and perform invasive procedures on a 24-hour basis, leaving patients little time for rest. Many patients become delirious in the intensive care unit because the noise, activity, brightness, and disturbance tend to persist around the clock, which contribute to delirium. Patients lose their sources for maintaining orientation and stability; that is, bright lighting at all times, as well as unfamiliar and abrupt increases in noise, can lead to a disruption in the circadian rhythm. In addition, patients in intensive care are more likely to receive multiple medications, and medications that are potentially harmful can aggravate the patient’s cognitive difficulties."

        "Choice 2": "Confusion Assessment Method",
        "Choice 3": "MMSE-2",
        "Choice 4": "Controlled Word Association Test",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The Confusion Assessment Method is a tool for measuring delirium in patients who are intubated or nonverbal. Assessing the accessory (CN XI) and hypoglossal (CN XII) cranial nerves provides clues about the patient’s ability to swallow. The nurse uses the Controlled Word Association Test to assess for a neurologic cause of an older adult’s cognitive dysfunction. This tool is an index of frontal lobe functioning and provides an assessment of executive function, including the patient’s frontal lobe functioning and his or her ability to refrain from distraction and perseveration. The MMSE-2 is a valid and reliable tool to assess cognitive function; however, it is unable to pinpoint discrete areas of neurologic dysfunction."

        "Explanation": "To help prevent cognitive dysfunction, postoperative complications, and an increased risk of morbidity and mortality, the nurse recognizes that the risk factors this older adult has for delirium include stressors, infection, and surgery; therefore to prevent cognitive decline and additional postoperative complications, the nurse promptly removes invasive devices such as intravenous infusions, urinary catheters, and wound drains. Removing these devices not only reduces the risk of infection, thromboembolic events, blood loss, injury, and fluid imbalance, but they also serve to promote mobility, promote a sense of control for the patient, and reduce the types of situations that can frighten the patient or that the patient can misinterpret."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 3, 4",
        "Explanation": "Major medical treatment, admission to long-term care, and pharmacological agents are all precipitating factors for delirium. Changes in surroundings often precipitate delirium. The development of delirium is a result of complex interactions among multiple causes. Delirium can result from the interaction of predisposing factors—vulnerability on the part of the individual as a result of predisposing conditions, such as cognitive impairment, severe illness, and sensory impairment; delirium can also result from precipitating factors and insults—medications, procedures, restraints, and iatrogenic events. Although a single factor (e.g., infection) can trigger an episode of delirium, several co-existing factors are also likely to be present. A highly vulnerable older individual requires a lesser amount of precipitating factors to develop delirium. Poor sleep habits is not a contributing factor in of itself."

Which of the following factors should the nurse use in patient teaching about sexual activity for an older adult with heart failure?",
        "Choice 1": "An older adult with heart failure should avoid sexual relations because of the demand it places on the heart.",
        "Choice 2": "Sexual relations and climbing six flights of stairs expend the same amount of energy.",

        "Explanation": "Sex is not restricted to young and healthy individuals; therefore the nurse provides the patient and his wife with information about safely resuming sexual intimacy. With appropriate cardiac rehabilitation, much of his capacity for exertion, such as sexual activity, can be restored. The energy expenditure for sexual activity varies; but, typically, it takes less energy than climbing six flights of stairs. The nurse must be prepared to discuss sexual issues with patients and seeks opportunities for discussion about sexual health."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Telling the resident to use the call bell if she becomes frightened offers assurances to the patient that she will be protected, but it neither confirms her suspicions nor makes a promise that cannot be kept. Replying that the staff receives training in ethics sounds as if the nurse is arguing in defense of the male staff member and does not help alleviate the resident’s fear, which can lead her to suspect that the nurse is also a part of the plot. Validating the woman’s impression contributes to the resident’s suspicions; in addition, the nurse increases professional liability risks by speaking about another resident in a negative manner.

        "Explanation": "Major crises or transitions, such as retirement or relocation to an assisted living or nursing facility, can contribute to the risk of suicide. Putting personal affairs in order, distributing possessions, making a will, or saying something similar to, “I won’t be around much longer,” can indicate a risk for suicide in a young person but can be a rational and mature act in older age.

Physical illness can interfere with the mental health of an older adult because the illness can interfere with the individual’s adaptive ability. A cognitive impairment can interfere with the mental health of an older adult because this impairment can destroy the older adult’s ability to adapt to new situations.

        "Explanation": "If an HMO is granted a per capita waiver, it cannot refuse an applicant on the basis of a preexisting condition. The eligibility age for full Social Security benefits is 66 years of age for persons born after 1937 and 67 years of age for those born in 1960 or later. Medicare, Part A, covers hospitalizations and other inpatient care. Medicare, Part B, which is optional insurance purchased by the beneficiary, covers outpatient services, physician visits, some therapy sessions, and some home health care.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Discharge planning begins on the first day of hospitalization. The case manager is responsible for ensuring that quality care is given accordingly in a specific time frame. The case manager facilitates discharge and contacts community-based resources to assist in the continuation of care. Keeping an older adult in the hospital as long as necessary is not required for the patient to receive the care he or she needs. Hospitalization is dangerous to older adults; therefore early discharge is encouraged. The case manager should negotiate with the HDP for the least restrictive level of care. Once the patient is in the hospital, any condition that the patient may have been neglecting should also be assessed and treated."

        "Explanation": "The health care provider assumes the intubated older adult lacks the cognitive skill to give consent for treatment. Before the search begins for the DPA and to help determine the patient’s cognitive status, the nurse assesses the patient for delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method for the intensive care unit. As the patient’s advocate, the nurse implements this valid and reliable tool because the nurse wants to give the patient every opportunity to participate in the plan of care and make his own determinations."

Although she failed to document it, her family states that she wanted to donate her organs. Given the law about a DPA, what does the nurse expect the surrogate to do?",
        "Choice 1": "Deny consent.",
        "Choice 2": "Refuse to decide.",
        "Choice 3": "Provide consent.",
        "Choice 4": "Get a second opinion.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "A DPA acts at the pleasure of the designator, can manage the designator’s finances, and functions as the designator’s health care surrogate, making judgments for the designator using substituted judgment when the designator is unable to do so. Therefore, in accordance with the law and the woman’s wishes according to her family, the surrogate should provide consent for organ harvesting. It is against the law and unethical for the DPA for this older adult to deny consent for organ harvesting. Because the attorney-in-fact named in the DPA is her health care surrogate, the attorney-in-fact must make a decision on behalf of the woman and cannot refuse to do so. The attorney-in-fact can get another opinion on the older adult’s neurological status but not as a way to avoid the decision concerning organ harvesting."

        "Explanation": "The nurse provides safe, effective, and comprehensive care but should not provide legal advice to an older adult; rather, the nurse should refer the patient to experts in the law and can assist the older adult with finding a suitable attorney.

Part B covers some costs of outpatient and ambulatory services. Hospice care is not a difference; Part A and Part B coverage is no longer available for a patient in hospice care.

The conservatee is a ward of the conservator or guardian and has no decision-making rights and, in many states, has no legal right to sue to terminate the conservatorship or guardianship.

Because the majority of caregiving occurs in the home and a majority of abuse occurs in the family, this caregiver has the characteristics of a potential abuser. Aggressive, combative, provocative, and overly demanding behavior is also characteristic of an older adult abuser. The lack of employment is not a characteristic of an elder abuser, although this problem can frustrate the individual; however, financial dependency on the abused is a predictor for abuse. Although smoking is an unhealthy habit and exposes the older adult to second-hand unhealthy air, smoking is not a characteristic of an elder abuser.

        "Choice 2": "Middle-aged adults and older parents reverse life-long caregiving roles with increasing age.",

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "As the dementia progresses, the patient may cease to recognize a spouse or child. The parent still remains the parent, and the idea that the parent somehow becomes a child again is demeaning. The older person may have significant support in the community where he or she lives. Older parents often remain the caregivers for disabled children, which is a serious burden."

        "Choice 1": "Good health",
        "Choice 2": "401k retirement plan",
        "Choice 3": "Private pension",
        "Choice 4": "Preretirement planning",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Good health is always a desirable state; however, if an older adult in poor health plans for retirement, then the transition to the changes of retirement can be smoother if the planning accounts for health challenges. With preretirement planning, private pensions are not obligatory. With preretirement planning, 401k retirement plans are not obligatory; however, these plans are effective saving plans for retirement; they allow employees to save pretax dollars. Preretirement planning is the most important aspect of a smooth transition into retirement because it affords the individual a chance to prepare for losses associated with retirement such as income, interpersonal communication, health insurance, status, influence, and other issues. Health, social, and financial planning help the older adult adapt to expected or sudden retirement."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Older adults with the most need for retirement planning are usually the same people who are least likely to receive it. The Mexican-American woman will most likely need preretirement counseling to avoid significant problems in retirement. She has three characteristics indicating a need for retirement planning: (1) her sex is female, (2) her job implies a lack of education or training, and (3) she does not pay into Social Security or federal taxes. Thus she can potentially fail to pay into the federal system for a sufficient length of time to be eligible for Social Security and Medicare benefits in retirement. In addition, her job is unlikely to offer a 401k plan."

        "Explanation": "The nurse suggests that the family work together to provide extended expressions of caring and concern for their mother; many small expressions of concern and caring from several sources help the bereaved gain the strength and confidence needed to survive a huge loss.

        "Explanation": "Overall financial planning is important to provide a stable source of income for retirement if individuals want to fulfill their retirement expectations. Company-sponsored benefits must be sufficient in retirement to avoid large, unplanned expenses. Health care expenses in retirement are more likely to be significant; therefore retirement health care must be adequate to avoid huge, unexpected expenses.

People older than 50 years of age are approximately one sixth as likely to use condoms during sex. Older women who are sexually active are at high risk for HIV, AIDS, and other sexually transmitted infections from an infected partner, resulting, in part, from normal age changes of the vaginal tissue—a thinner, drier, friable vaginal lining that makes viral entry more efficient.

To facilitate the family with decision making, the nurse asks one family member to consider calling another person who will likely help the family face the reality of the death. After making the suggestion, the nurse ensures that the family has enough time for holding behaviors, to prepare the body if they wish, and to express their grief in privacy and in their own way. Effective coping includes a focus on the solutions rather than on the problems. The nurse avoids recommending funeral homes, which could be a potential conflict of interest.

        "Explanation": "The dying patient is most likely to benefit from the care of the palliative care nurse by affording the patient as much control as possible, providing effective nursing care for symptom control and by providing continuity of care as the palliative care team directs total patient care. In providing control, the nurse asks the patient to determine activities and how time is spent."

Even if the resident needed to accept the reality of her spouse’s death, the resident’s grief process and personal space should be respected. Although the resident’s argumentative nature can indicate early dementia, the resident’s behavior can also be understood as a healthy defense of personal space. Although the rationale of the nurse assistant is probably that the clutter from all the personal items is a safety and liability risk, the assistant should realize that this resident is entitled to the personal use of her personal space."

If the residents were moving into the new building in a few days, then the nurse’s response might be suitable; however, without specifying a time limit, the nurse has violated the resident’s right to voice a grievance and have it remedied.

        "Choice 4": "Tour of the new facility shortly after transfer",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "To help assess the resident for stress, the nurse reviews the sequence of events that led to the relocation including whether the resident had relocation options and what those options were before relocation. If the resident played an active role in the choice of facilities and had several available options, then the resident is likely to experience less stress upon relocation. The length of stay in the acute care facility is an unreliable index of stress in a resident who has been recently relocated. The presence of familiar people is an unreliable predictor of relocation stress. Touring the new facility is an unreliable predictor of relocation stress; if the tour is conducted too soon or when the resident is in pain, tired, or distracted, then the resident is unlikely to benefit from the tour."

Medication discrepancies are the most prevalent adverse event after hospital discharge and the most challenging component of a successful hospital-to-home transition. Nurses’ attention to an accurate prehospital medication list, medication reconciliation during hospitalization and at discharge, and patient and family education about medications are required to enhance safety.

Receiving the Sacrament can potentially relieve much of the patient’s anxiety. Arranging an appointment with an Episcopal priest for the resident is not an appropriate intervention; the two belief systems are not the same, and the resident is unlikely to experience the minister’s efforts as satisfactory. Reporting the resident’s change in behavior to the attending physician is also inappropriate; the resident’s wish can be understood entirely within the resident’s belief system and need not reflect a medical problem, particularly if a visit by a priest relieves the resident’s anxiety.

        "Explanation": "Using the LEARN model (Listen with sympathy to the patient’s perception of the problem; Explain your perception of the problem; Acknowledge the differences and similarities; Recommend treatment; and Negotiate agreement), the nurse gathers information from the patient about cultural beliefs concerning health care and avoids stereotyping the patient. In the assessment, the nurse determines what the patient believes about caregiving, decision making, treatment, and other pertinent health-related information. Speaking with the health care provider is premature until the assessment is complete. Unless he accepts the beliefs, principles of the holistic health system can be potentially unsuitable and insulting for this patient. Unless he accepts the treatments, consulting with a practitioner of Chinese medicine can also be unsuitable and insulting for this patient."

        "Choice 1": "Speak in an exaggerated pitch.",
        "Choice 2": "Use a lower quality of speech.",
        "Choice 3": "Use endearing terms such as “Honey.”",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Some health professionals demonstrate ageism, in part because providers tend to see many frail, older persons, and fewer of those who are healthy and active. Providers should not assume all older adults are hearing or mentally impaired. The most appropriate action when addressing an older adult would be to speak clearly. Examples of unintentional ageism in language are exaggerated pitch, demeaning emotional tone, and a lower quality of speech."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "When working with an interpreter, the nurse closely watches the older adult for nonverbal communication and emotion regarding a specific topic and therefore validates the assessment about the older adult’s tension before proceeding. Because the nurse notices her tension, the nurse temporarily suspends the preparation to validate her assessment. If the nurse proceeds and the older adult is uncomfortable discussing elimination, then important instructions can be missed, leading to adverse effects for the older adult. Repeating the instructions can aggravate the older adult’s discomfort. Instructing the older adult to repeat the nurse’s instruction ignores the her needs."

        "Explanation": "Cultural competence means having the skills to put cultural knowledge to use in assessment, communication, negotiation, and intervention. To provide culturally competent care, the nurse gathers data about the culture, the older adult, and the specific culture’s impact on the older adult, organizes the data, and applies the information by planning, implementing, and evaluating nursing care. Planning includes supporting cultural patterns. Assessing includes increasing cultural knowledge. Through increased knowledge, nurses can better assess the strengths and weaknesses of the older adult within the context of their culture and know when and how to effectively intervene to support rather than hinder cultural patterns that enhance wellness and coping."

        "Choice 4": "Experience with discomfort",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The nurse uses knowledge of the culture’s influence on the older adult in relation to decision making to avoid unnecessary tension and misunderstanding and thus to facilitate the process of informed consent. The nurse uses the information about decision making by sharing the cultural information with the health care provider and by addressing the culturally suitable member of the family for informed consent. Caregiving is unrelated to the process of informed consent. Death and dying, although potentially relevant, is unrelated to informed consent. Relevant to surgical procedures, the older adult and family experiences with pain and discomfort are important to the pain management plan."

The nurse can be incorrectly assuming that he practices and believes in the magicoreligious system. The nurse should assess his spiritual beliefs and determine how much they influence his attitudes toward Western health care. The magicoreligious system maintains social relationships in good condition to prevent illness; however, if the older adult does not follow this cultural practice, then this goal can be unsuitable.

        "Explanation": "Although the skin of an older person may require 48 to 72 hours to mount an initial inflammatory response to a wound, increasing redness after that time, particularly with purulent discharge, is a sign of infection. This change is normal as ridges in the skin are lost. Melanin distribution becomes more uneven with age. Hair is commonly lost from the legs and other areas of older adults. Hair loss from the legs is not a sign of peripheral vascular disease."

        "Explanation": "The hardwood floor provides an even surface. If the daylight from the large windows causes a glare problem, then curtains may be used. Throw rugs can slide underfoot and can lead to a fall, particularly when the sense of balance has declined with age. The fluorescent lighting can lead to a glare problem, and the irregularities of the natural stone floor can lead to a fall. The linoleum floor also presents a glare problem, and overheating is a risk in older persons who have a reduced sweat-gland response to heat."

        "Choice 4": "Cross-link theory",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Genetic researchers have found that telomeres shorten with each cellular reproduction and continue to do so until the cell dies. Selected animal studies since the 1930s conclude that calorie restrictions of 30% can lead to a longer life expectancy, slower metabolism, lower body temperature, and delay of age-related disorders. The pacemaker theory, which is also known as the neuroendocrine control theory, holds that critical functions of selected endocrine glands slow and can halt with age. The cross-link theory suggests that aging is a result of the stiffening of proteins caused by cross-linking, leading to stiffer joints, rougher skin, and decreased cellular elasticity."

        "Explanation": "The loss of balance from a musculoskeletal perspective is usually due to a loss of core muscle strength, thus the nurse suggests standing on one foot at a time while holding onto a chair back, if necessary, and working to increase the duration of the exercise. Lifting weights helps increase muscle strength. Sit-ups are contraindicated for older adults because they put tremendous amounts of stress on the lumbar spine.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The nurse’s priority is to maintain oxygen saturation above 95% to help provide oxygen that the heart is unable to provide. The heart of this older adult is less able to respond to increased oxygen demands from infection because of age-related changes in the myocardium including ventricular hypertrophy and decreased coronary blood flow and changes in pulmonary function. Further, because this older adult is malnourished and thus likely to have anemia, any capacity to meet increased oxygen demand is stymied. Along with airway, breathing and circulation are two of the three most basic needs. Similarly, the older heart may not be able to respond to other calls for increased cardiac demand such as infection, anemia, pneumonia, cardiac dysrhythmias, surgery, diarrhea, hypoglycemia, malnutrition, and drug-induced and noncardiac illnesses such as renal disease and prostatic obstruction."

        "Choice 3": "Promote coughing and deep breathing.",
        "Choice 4": "Analyze the electrocardiogram’s rhythm.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The nurse implements coughing and deep breathing because of the older man’s history of exposure to environmental toxins from the paint vapor. Therefore to promote oxygenation and ventilation and to prevent atelectasis and pneumonia, the nurse instructs him to cough and deep breathe at regular intervals. Hypercholesterolemia is a common co-morbidity with coronary artery disease; if his total cholesterol is greater than 200 mg/dl, then the nurse should provide a low-cholesterol diet. Inhalation of paint vapor over a long period has adverse effects primarily on the lungs. However, some hepatotoxic substances are used in health care, such as immunosuppressants and aminoglycoside antibiotics, and must be given to this individual with caution. Because he had a MI, the nurse closely monitors the heart’s rhythm to detect ventricular dysrhythmias, tachycardia, and other potentially harmful rhythms, but such abnormal rhythms are unlikely to be directly related to his occupational history."

        "Explanation": "Antibiotics and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents such as naproxen can cause kidney damage from various mechanisms; thus the nurse monitors the urine creatinine because it reflects the system’s ability to clear waste products and is especially important for gauging appropriate medication administration. Unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin reflects the liver’s ability to conjugate serum bilirubin. Serum creatinine, also a reflection of renal function, usually remains stable throughout life.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The nurse begins by reviewing the medication list to find substances that are likely to cause constipation such as opioid analgesics and antidepressants, among others. If the patient is taking an opioid analgesic and because the patient rates the pain as 3 out of 10, then a change in pain medication can help relieve constipation. The use of a laxative can be contraindicated and is the therapy of last resort for constipation caused by factors other than opioid analgesics. Promoting fiber in the diet is a reasonable intervention but can be made unnecessary by omitting the opioid analgesic. Increasing fluid intake is a reasonable nursing intervention for older adults with and without constipation, but it can be unnecessary for this older adult."

        "Choice 2": "Decreased gastric smooth muscle",
        "Choice 3": "Short, broad small intestinal villi",
        "Choice 4": "Decreased large intestinal motility",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Villi of the small intestine shorten and widen with age and, as a result, become less functional, which contributes to malabsorption of nutrients; despite a healthy diet, nutrients are absorbed primarily in the small intestines. The concept of malabsorption is what the nurse uses to plan care; this nursing diagnosis refers to the inability of the body to absorb nutrients as a result of biological factors. Decreased intrinsic factor secretion leads to pernicious anemia as a result of the inability to absorb vitamin B12 in the stomach. Gastric smooth muscle is not present in the intestines. Decreased large intestine motility is an age-associated problem; however, it should have no impact on absorption in the small intestine."

        "Question": "Which factor(s) associated with aging contribute(s) to the high incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in older adults? (Select all that apply.)",
        "Choice 1": "Fewer T-lymphocytes",
        "Choice 2": "Less lean muscle mass",
        "Choice 3": "Decreased thyroid function",
        "Choice 4": "Decreased physical activity",
        "Choice 5": "Left ventricular hypertrophy",
        "Choice 6": "Decreased insulin sensitivity",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "2, 3, 4, 6",
        "Explanation": "Less lean muscle mass means that the body has fewer insulin receptor sites; thus glucose circulates in the blood stream longer, leading to hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Decreased thyroid function decreases the metabolic rate. If the metabolic rate decreases without a corresponding decrease in caloric intake, then the body consumes more food than it needs for its metabolic rate and hyperglycemia occurs. Decreased physical activity contributes to type 2 diabetes in two ways. First, a less active person has less lean muscle mass than an active person. Second, physical activity helps metabolize glucose; if activity decreases and food consumption does not decrease, then hyperglycemia occurs. Insulin sensitivity decreases with age and increases the need for insulin in older adults. To prevent hyperglycemia, the older adult must increase physical activity and decrease food consumption."

        "Question": "During a walk, an older man suffers a laceration from a broken tree branch. Rank the nurse’s interventions in order, beginning with the most important intervention.",
        "Choice 1": "Flush and cleanse the wound well.",
        "Choice 2": "Investigate a possible safety hazard.",
        "Choice 3": "Instruct him to keep the wound covered.",
        "Choice 4": "Verify a current tetanus immunization.",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 2, 3, 4",
        "Explanation": "Flushing and cleansing the wound helps prevent the invasion of potential pathogens from the tree into the man’s system. This most basic nursing intervention is the nurse’s first priority because it helps maintain physiological functioning. Without the wound being clean, the remaining nursing interventions cannot be effective. The second most important task for the nurse is to instruct the patient to keep the wound covered; the inflammatory response can take 48 to 72 hours to begin in an older adult. Covering the wound will help keep the wound clean and prevent contamination. Without the action of the body’s defense mechanisms at the wound in an older adult, inflammatory mediators remain inactive, allowing potential pathogens to remain unchecked, increasing the risk for infection. The third most important task is for the nurse to ensure that the older adult has a current tetanus immunization; tetanus is associated with breaks in the skin. The lowest-priority task for the nurse is to ensure the broken tree branch does not present a safety hazard; therefore the nurse questions the older adult for additional information and takes any necessary action to prevent another accident."

        "Choice 1": "Testes soften",
        "Choice 2": "Sperm count decreases",

        "Explanation": "Although men have the ability to produce sperm throughout their lives, they also experience changes in the functioning of the reproductive and the urogenital organs in later life. The changes are usually more subtle and noticed only as they accumulate, beginning when men are in their 50s. The testes atrophy and soften. The seminiferous tubules thicken, and obstruction caused by sclerosis and fibrosis can occur. Although sperm count does not decrease, fertility may be reduced because of a higher number of sperm lack motility or have structural abnormalities. Erectile changes are also seen; more stimulation is needed to achieve a full erection, ejaculation is slower and less forceful, and refractory periods are longer."

None of these theories is clearly supported by data. Peck’s tasks of ego differentiation, body transcendence, and ego transcendence demand a great deal of courage and energy that not everyone possesses.

        "Explanation": "Nerve cells regenerate in the hippocampus; this is a true statement. Although neurons can regenerate in the hippocampus, regeneration is impeded by stress. Overall cognitive abilities are progressively degraded by neuron loss in the cerebral cortex with aging; this statement is not true. Neuron loss does not harm overall cognitive ability, although it makes neural processes run more slowly. Improving cognitive functions in an older person calls for sporadic mental activity around ideas the person finds significant and interesting; this is not a true statement. Neural functions can be retrained, but “exercising” the brain on a regular basis is necessary. Older adults learn best when new information is relevant to what is already familiar. Mood does not influence whether an older person remembers verbal instructions; this is a not a true statement.

When an older adult loses a spouse, the loss can include economic security, especially for a woman, and societal roles. Alterations in these roles are not usually as challenging as the loss of a spouse. Grandparenting can offer the potential for enhanced social experiences for an older adult; however, adults can age well without them when more basic needs are met. Alterations in these roles are not always as acutely demanding as the loss of a spouse. Alterations in these roles usually call for little or a gradual adjustment."

        "Explanation": "In the age-stratification model, historical context is used to understand members of a cohort in terms of similar events, conditions, and circumstances and the effect these have on the group as a whole. A good example of such a cohort is older adults who lived through World War II. Biological context is not important in considering the age-stratification theory.

        "Explanation": "Engaging in physical activity and social interaction are associated with a lower risk for Alzheimer disease. Keeping the curtains open can make a resident’s room more pleasant but is likely to be counterproductive in lowering the risk; brightening the room can entice the resident to stay in the room and decrease social interaction. Stringing beads is a passive and sedentary activity and therefore unlikely to decrease the risk for Alzheimer disease; physical activity is associated with a lower risk for Alzheimer disease.

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Dendrites are the receiving end of neurons (receiving electrochemical signals) and the branched ends extending from the cell body. The atrophy of dendrites contributes to slower thought processes with aging because the synapses are impaired; this changes the transmission of neurotransmitters that are vital in the transmission of an electrical impulse from neuron to neuron. The secretion of cholinesterase, the enzyme that inactivates acetylcholine in the synapse, does not increase with aging. Changes in the transmission of neurotransmitters are associated with the atrophy of dendrites. The spinal cord and the cerebral cortex lose neurons with age, the cerebral cortex more than the spinal cord."

Enabling the team to provide care that meets individual needs is a primary reason; documentation is necessary to ensure that the team has accurate and complete information about the resident’s specific conditions. Enabling the patient to receive consistent care is a primary reason; documentation enables nurses on later shifts to be aware of conditions that have developed and the actions that have been taken on previous shifts.

        "Question": "An older woman has diabetes mellitus and requires hemodialysis for renal failure. She is discharged to home to recover from a sternal wound infection and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). A home care nurse will provide wound care. Which of the following is the major justification for the complete and accurate documentation of this older adult’s care?",
        "Choice 1": "Requires complex health care",
        "Choice 2": "Has needs in multiple settings",
        "Choice 3": "Is at risk for iatrogenic problems",
        "Choice 4": "Has significant health care expenses",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The major reason that documentation of this patient’s health care must be accurate and complete is that she has complex health care needs in multiple settings and experiences a high risk for iatrogenic problems and high reimbursement expenses. The duration of her care is likely to be lengthy; the sternal wound infection after CABG is serious because of the potential for sternal osteomyelitis. In addition, individuals with diabetes are at high risk for infection and are slow to heal."

        "Choice 3": "Document the medication as given.",
        "Choice 4": "Administer the patient’s medication.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The nurse verifies the patient’s identify to avoid computer errors before proceeding with administering the medication. Although computers were introduced to reduce documentation errors, verification of computer information is safe, effective nursing care. Checking for allergies is a reasonable nursing action; however, if a computer error misidentified the patient, then checking allergies of the wrong person can result in misidentification and serious adverse effects for this older adult. The nurse avoids documenting the medication as given until after the patient takes or receives the medication. The nurse avoids administering the medication until after verifying the patient identity a second time for safety. Further, regulatory agencies can require multiple forms of patient identification."

        "Explanation": "NOC helps the nurse categorize the desired end-result of nursing care with specific, measurable, patient-oriented, and time-sensitive endpoints for the patient to achieve. A nursing diagnosis from NANDA identifies the patient problem and the associated nursing interventions and outcomes for the problem. Nursing goals classification does not exist. NIC is a set of nursing interventions whose basis is found in evidence-based nursing and is associated with a specific nursing diagnosis."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Mandated by the federal government to improve the quality of care for nursing home residents, the nurse uses the RAI to help residents in nursing homes achieve optimal functional status. The RAI includes identification of issues with the MDS, a comprehensive assessment from Resident Assessment Protocols (RAPs), and the foundation for reimbursement using the RUG. Narrative progress notes are used in nursing homes to describe events that are unsuitable for other forms of documentation in the medical record. Problem-oriented documentation identifies resident problems, the plan of care to resolve the problem, and the outcome of the problem or response to treatment. The RUG is the reimbursement tool in the RAI."

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The nurse uses the RAPs to assess triggers identified from the MDS. To help the resident achieve optimal functional status by determining his strengths, needs, and preferences, RAPs provide an organized framework used by the health care team for additional assessment of the trigger. The nurse develops the care plan after completing the RAPs. The nurse assigns suitable nursing interventions to the plan of care. The nurse uses agency-approved policies to provide care as assigned in the plan of care."

        "Choice 1": "Present the patient with a Spanish version of the information access document.",
        "Choice 2": "Have an English-speaking family member explain the document to the patient.",
        "Choice 3": "Explain the document to the patient using an interpreter to ensure understanding.",
        "Choice 4": "Instruct an interpreter to read the information access document to the resident privately.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "To ensure patient understanding, the nurse explains a patient’s rights about information access to the patient with the assistance of an interpreter. The nurse is responsible for patient understanding and thus cannot relinquish this task to another person. When understanding is reached concerning the rights associated with access to information, the patient can then make an informed decision about releasing health care information and thus maintain privacy. The nurse cannot ensure patient understanding without discussing the document with the patient using an interpreter. The nurse cannot delegate a nursing responsibility to a family member; the nurse does not have the right to release the health information to anyone. In private or public, the nurse cannot delegate this task to another person."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 2, 5, 6",
        "Explanation": "An institution uses the same nursing documentation record because it helps provide continuity of care across various settings by providing organized, pertinent, and thorough health care data on a specific individual. Other units in the hospital and other health care settings have an easier time locating relevant data. Specific health care data are found in one location on a standardized nursing documentation record throughout an institution and provide the basis for standardized patient evaluation across settings. Standardized documents help describe patient acuity levels and thus provide a justification for staffing. Because the same parameters are, or should be, recorded across all units, the standardized documentation record allows for hospital-wide quality evaluations. Nurses must restrict access to a standardized documentation record or any other type of patient record such as laboratory reports, narrative or progress notes, and other documents. A standardized nursing documentation record can reduce a specific type of documentation error but is unlikely to affect the rate of medication errors."

        "Explanation": "The Clock Drawing Test, which has been used since 1992, is a screening tool that helps identify those with a cognitive impairment and is used as a measure of severity. The Mini-Cog was developed as a tool that could establish cognitive status more quickly than the MMSE and the limitations of educational adjustments. It is now the recommended evidenced-based tool and combines one aspect of the MMSE (short-term memory recall) with the test of executive function of the Clock Drawing Test. It has been found to be highly sensitive to diagnosing dementia. The MMSE tool has been used most often and is a 30-item instrument that has been used to screen for cognitive difficulties and is one of the tools often used in determining a diagnosis of dementia or delirium. Fulmer SPICES is an overall assessment tool developed in 2007."

        "Choice 1": "Absorption",
        "Choice 2": "Metabolism",
        "Choice 3": "Distribution",
        "Choice 4": "Excretion",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Decreased intestinal motility increases the amount of time a substance remains in contact with the intestinal mucosa of the small intestine, where most absorption takes place. With increased exposure, absorption can be increased and the drug effect enhanced. Many medications taken by older adults can also decrease intestinal motility, thereby complicating the titration of medications or introducing new adverse effects through drug-to-drug interactions. Decreased body water leads to higher serum concentrations of water-soluble drugs, increased body fat increases the longevity of fat-soluble drugs, and decreased serum albumin increases the serum concentration of serum protein–bound drugs. Reduced liver mass and hepatic dysfunction can impair oxidative metabolism, which can lead to an accumulation of toxic levels of a drug. Impaired renal function can impair the excretion of drugs through the kidneys."

        "Question": "Which medication is correctly matched to the condition given of an older adult patient according to current medical knowledge?",
        "Choice 1": "Methylphenidate (Ritalin) for depression at bedtime",
        "Choice 2": "Buspirone (BuSpar) for chronic anxiety states",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Buspirone (BuSpar) is safer for older adults with anxiety than benzodiazepines. Because it can take up to 5 to 7 days for the therapeutic benefit to be realized, it should be used only for chronic anxiety. Stimulants such as methylphenidate (Ritalin) should be administered in low doses in patients with chronic depression. To prevent insomnia, extended-release forms should be administered early in the morning and short-acting forms at the latest in the early afternoon. Tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline (Elavil) are contraindicated for use with older adults because of the risk for anticholinergic and sedative effects. Tricyclic antidepressants have been replaced with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are more effective at lower doses with fewer side effects. Antipsychotic agents such as haloperidol (Haldol) can cause extrapyramidal effects, especially in older adults. For long-term administration, they should be used only after a thorough psychiatric evaluation."

        "Choice 1": "“You take digoxin (Lanoxin) at the correct time, don’t you?”",
        "Choice 2": "“Why didn’t you take all of your digoxin (Lanoxin) last month?”",

        "Choice 4": "“You have never missed a dose of digoxin (Lanoxin), have you?”",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "“How many doses of digoxin (Lanoxin) do you think you missed?” is a question that is worded to put the client at ease and to elicit information in a matter-of-fact way. “You take digoxin (Lanoxin) at the correct time, don’t you?” sounds like a challenge to the patient’s personal qualities. In addition, the nurse is leading the patient to the answer. The patient is likely to respond simply, “Oh, yes.” Although the question, “Why didn’t you take all of your digoxin (Lanoxin) last month?” is meant to elicit the reason for nonadherence, it has an accusatory tone that is likely to make the patient defensive. “You have never missed a dose of digoxin (Lanoxin), have you?” is a question that can be interpreted as judgmental."

        "Explanation": "Bupropion is a safe antidepressant for an older adult that is also less likely to cause sexual dysfunction than other nonsteroidal SSRIs. Indomethacin is unsuitable for an older adult because it produces the most central nervous system effects of all nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents. Reserpine is unsuitable for an older adult because it poses a risk of depression, sedation, and orthostatic hypotension.

        "Choice 4": "Alkaline phosphatase",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Antibiotics, as a group of drugs, are hard on the kidneys; thus the nurse should check the creatinine clearance of this individual. Although approximately 30% of absorbed vancomycin is protein bound, it is cleared by the kidneys, and creatinine clearance is the best index available of renal function. Because approximately 70% of vancomycin circulates in the bloodstream in the active form, the dose must be reduced or the dosing intervals increased to maintain the desired drug level and to prevent toxicity in the older adult who has renal dysfunction. The pathogen is already identified; however, some value can be obtained from subsequent stool cultures to determine whether the infection is eradicated. Serum potassium is a reasonable parameter to check in an older adult; however, if used as a measure of renal function, then the creatinine clearance is a better choice. Alkaline phosphatase is a measure of hepatic function and a reasonable parameter to check when administering medications; hepatic clearance is important in the metabolism of many medications."

To take advantage of rhythmical variations in heart disease, the best time to administer long-acting diltiazem (Cardizem LA) is at bedtime; the medication will then be active in the early morning hours when a cardiovascular event is most likely to take place. Midday administration is a less advantageous time for the medication administration because the main period of drug activity will occur in the evening. Morning administration is too late for administration because morning administration misses the critical period around 4 and 5 AM. Administering Cardizem LA every 4 hours is contraindicated because it is a long-acting formulation meant to be administered once daily."

        "Explanation": "Drug-food interactions may either decrease or increase the amount absorbed. For example, when a bisphosphonate such as Fosamax is taken with food of any kind, the absorption is reduced to only a few milligrams; therefore the drug has no effect on the target organ—the bones. If a patient misses a dose, then he or she should not take it as soon as remembered; it should be taken at its next scheduled dose. No current recommendations suggest that calcium levels are to be checked monthly."

        "Explanation": "The nurse’s priority is to stop this older adult’s intake of chamomile supplements at home; they will increase the effectiveness of anticoagulation. The nurse instructs this individual to avoid chamomile while she is taking an anticoagulant because the woman’s blood will be much less able to clot, exposing her to a very high risk of a catastrophic injury in the event of a fall or trauma. The patient does not need to supplement with only ginkgo; the patient should cease taking ginkgo while on anticoagulant therapy, as well as the use of garlic supplements. Both increase the effectiveness of anticoagulation. The use of Hawthorn supplements has not been shown to affect the use of anticoagulant medications."

        "Question": "The nurse provides instruction about medication safety to older adults. Which instruction should the nurse provide?",
        "Choice 1": "Nausea and vomiting are common, harmless drug side effects.",
        "Choice 2": "Keep a supply of medications at the bedside for convenience.",
        "Choice 3": "Ask the health care provider to describe the purpose of therapy.",
        "Choice 4": "Take your daily medications on an empty stomach with water.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Older adults should ask the health care provider for the purpose of each drug and record the information. Although nausea and vomiting are among the most common adverse effects of pharmacotherapy, they can indicate medication toxicity and should be reported to the health care provider. Keeping a medication at the bedside is dangerous for anyone and can be especially dangerous for older adults who are taking antianxiety agents, hypnotic agents, and opioid analgesics; these and other medications can cause respiratory depression with and without excessive dosing. If sleepy or lethargic, then the older adult can inadvertently take more than the correct dose and suffer serious consequences as a result. Taking a medication on an empty stomach with water is a suitable instruction for many medications; however, many medications that are likely to cause nausea are taken with food. The nurse should instruct older adults to keep a record of the recommended method of administration."

        "Question": "An older man is taking aripiprazole (Abilify) for agitation. Which patient assessment is the nurse’s priority to prevent catastrophic effects of the medication?",
        "Choice 1": "Oral and facial dyskinesia",
        "Choice 2": "Muscle spasms of the face",
        "Choice 3": "Mask facies, shuffling gait",
        "Choice 4": "Repetitive aimless walking",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "This individual is taking an atypical antipsychotic agent to control manic episodes of dementia. Although these agents are less likely to cause tardive dyskinesia (TD), the nurse monitors for the associated abnormal movements of TD including oral and facial dyskinesia, which is an impairment in the ability to execute voluntary facial movement. The nurse immediately reports this effect to stop therapy and to prevent an irreversible condition. Mask facies, having a masklike appearance, and shuffling gait are parkinsonian side effects of antipsychotic agents and can be improved with antiparkinsonian agents. Muscle spasms of the face, tongue, neck, and back are adverse effects of antipsychotic agents usually observed within the first 5 days of therapy. They are potential indicators of acute dystonia and can be improved with antiparkinsonian agents. Motor restlessness is an adverse effect of antipsychotic agents and is characteristic of akathisia."

        "Choice 1": "Biscuits and gravy",
        "Choice 2": "Whole grain bread",
        "Choice 3": "Coffee with cream",
        "Choice 4": "Mixed green salad",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Because antipsychotic medications potentially impair the body’s thermoregulatory ability, the nurse instructs an older adult who takes an antipsychotic agent such as chlorpromazine to avoid caffeinated beverages because they contribute to dehydration. This man is at high risk for organ damage as a result of hyperthermia from mild elevations in the environmental temperature; therefore he must avoid dehydration, stay in cool temperatures, keep out of direct sunlight, and alert people around him and caregivers to monitor his temperature carefully and to be prepared to provide cooling sponge baths, cool liquids, and other measures to reduce his temperature quickly. The nurse instructs all older adults to avoid eating biscuits and gravy because these items have an excessively high fat content. Whole grain bread is a healthy food item to choose. Mixed green salad is a healthy food item to choose."

        "Question": "An older woman who takes escitalopram (Lexapro) 10 mg by mouth daily states she does not feel better after 1 week of treatment. Rank the interventions in order, starting with the first intervention the nurse should implement to facilitate patient compliance with therapy.",
        "Choice 1": "Tell her that the beneficial effects can take 4 to 6 weeks to appear.",
        "Choice 2": "Instruct her to take the medication as prescribed without stopping.",
        "Choice 3": "Suggest hard candy, ice chips, and sips of water for a dry mouth.",
        "Choice 4": "Collaborate with the health care provider to provide an increased dose.",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 2, 3, 4",
        "Explanation": "Usually, older adults are sensitive to the effects of medications, but under normal circumstances, the therapeutic effect of escitalopram and other SSRI antidepressant medications can take up to 4 to 6 weeks to appear. Conversely, if an individual who is taking an antidepressant experiences adverse effects of the medication, then the individual should be instructed to take the medication continually as prescribed for 1 to 2 months before abandoning the therapy; the untoward effects usually diminish or disappear with time. To bolster the initial intervention, the nurse instructs the older adult to continue therapy without stopping because consistent, daily administration is the best method of achieving the full beneficial effects of an antidepressant. A common, early adverse effect of antidepressant therapy is dry mouth; therefore the nurse supplies the individual with strategies for effectively counteracting the anticholinergic effects of this medication. The nurse assists the older adult with strategies to manage antidepressant therapy before asking for an increased dose. Titration of an antidepressant medication for an older adult is a slow process because of increased sensitivity to the effects of the medication. In addition, dosing trial and error is a common strategy for determining an individual’s optimal dose."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 2, 3, 5, 6",
        "Explanation": "The intake of chamomile, garlic, ginkgo, ginseng, and green tea supplements at home should be avoided because each increases the effectiveness of anticoagulation. Individuals should avoid these herbal supplements while taking an anticoagulant because the patient’s blood will be significantly less able to clot, exposing him or her to the risk of a catastrophic injury in the event of a fall or trauma. The use of Hawthorn supplements has not been shown to affect the use of anticoagulants."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Daily recommendation is 1200 mg of calcium, and 600 to 800 units of vitamin D are needed to enable the body to use the calcium. Daily vitamin B12 intake is correct, but older adults require 20 g to 35 g of fiber. Although 1600 calories per day is correct, fluid intake (preferably water) should be 1500 ml, approximately six to eight 8-oz glasses. Vitamin B12 intake should be 2.4 mcg per day, and calories from fat should be 20% to 25%."

        "Explanation": "Decreased motility in the esophagus is a common age-related change and can affect the ease of swallowing. A loss of the majority of taste buds is not a common age-related physical change. A small number of taste buds are lost beginning around 60 years of age, but it does not affect all flavors equally. Decreased cholecystokinin secretion is not common; however, increased cholecystokinin secretion is. A loss of smell is not a common age-related physical change."

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Older persons often have difficulty in obtaining adequate transportation to remote supermarkets and may choose light-weight but less nutritious food items rather than heavy fresh fruits and vegetables. Cholesterol phobia, or the excessive concern over cholesterol control, can contribute to malnutrition in older adults. Every culture has some particular foods and ways of preparing food that can bring great comfort for a person raised in that culture.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Only nutritious food that is actually eaten can enhance a person’s nutritional status. Older adults are more likely to eat food they like, and seasonings can make food more palatable. Developing a seating chart for the main dining room based on the unit to facilitate a more organized and efficient meal delivery is not for the benefit of the residents but is an action for the benefit of management and degrades the dignity of the residents. Older adults require greater amounts of light to see; candlelight can be too dim to see adequately. Distributing “med-pass” nutritional supplements are costly and often are not dispensed or are not consumed as ordered."

        "Question": "The nurse instructs the unlicensed assistive personnel to feed an older adult. If the nurse is unable to observe feeding directly, then which action should the nurse use to assess the older adult’s risk for aspiration immediately after feeding?",
        "Choice 1": "Note food volume eaten.",
        "Choice 2": "Inspect for pocketing.",
        "Choice 3": "Observe skin color.",
        "Choice 4": "Monitor for bradypnea.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The nurse is able to assess the risk for aspiration by assessing the adult for pocketing, which is residual accumulations or pockets of food in the mouth that the older adult can aspirate after the meal is complete. If food is found in the mouth, then the nurse removes it and evaluates the current plan of care. The amount of food consumed by an older adult is unrelated to the risk of aspiration; therefore noting the amount of food that is eaten is unsuitable for detecting the risk for aspiration. An alteration in circulation as evidenced by a change in skin color can be a late indicator of aspiration. Thus a change in skin color can indicate the presence of aspiration, but the older adult with a change in skin color is not necessarily at risk for aspiration. The nurse monitors for tachypnea as an indicator of aspiration; however, tachypnea does not indicate a risk for aspiration."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The nurse provides oral care every 4 hours and brushes the teeth after meals to decrease the microorganism count in the mouth of an older adult with a gastrostomy tube. Foam swabs are ineffective tools to remove plaque, regardless of the toothpaste. Because this older adult has difficulty with the dominant hand, providing oral care supplies can be a waste of time, unless the nurse assists the older adult to maintain oral health with the supplies. The nurse positions the older adult at a 30- to 45-degree angle during tube feedings to facilitate gastric emptying."

        "Choice 1": "Instruct the feeding assistants to feed four people at a time.",
        "Choice 2": "Draw on the availability of family members who are able to follow instructions.",
        "Choice 3": "Ask some residents to self-feed for part of the mealtime.",
        "Choice 4": "Assign a small group of nursing assistants to do the feeding.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "With adequate training and cooperation, the nurse allows family members to feed residents who need assistance with feeding. While the family is assisting with feeding, the nurse supervises the feeding, offers feedback to family members, if necessary, and evaluates the outcome. The nurse avoids assigning more than three residents to each assistant for feeding; four residents are too many to assist safely. If a resident needs assistance with feeding, then attempting to self-feed can be dangerous, humiliating, and frustrating for a resident. If a small group of assistants performs all of the feeding, then the residents will potentially have to wait for long periods before being fed. Since the time required to implement feeding assistance is 38 minutes, a lengthy delay can result in adverse effects or injury for the resident and increase the risk of errors for the assistants, leading to frustration with the residents."

Because it is a potentially life-threatening situation, the nurse’s priority is to prevent a thromboembolic event, including deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The patient is likely to have low circulating blood volume as evidenced by tachycardia, which is a compensatory mechanism when the tissues receive inadequate oxygenation. In addition, compensatory mechanisms that help restore fluid balance are limited in the older adult. This limitation results in poorer tissue perfusion and an increased risk for thrombus formation for a patient who is on bed rest; a lack of skeletal muscle action promotes pooling of blood in the extremities."

        "Question": "The nurse notices that an older adult’s urine is greenish-brown. Which step should the nurse implement next?",
        "Choice 1": "Increase oral fluid intake.",
        "Choice 2": "Evaluate the medication list.",
        "Choice 3": "Review laboratory reports.",
        "Choice 4": "Determine fluid volume status.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The nurse assesses the older adult’s fluid status to develop a suitable plan of care. The nurse selects the correct nursing interventions, depending on the cause of the problem. Increasing oral fluid intake is implemented after the nurse completes the fluid assessment, if the intervention is determined to be suitable. The nurse reviews pertinent laboratory data as part of the fluid assessment. The nurse evaluates the medication list as part of the fluid assessment to eliminate a medication as the cause of the dark urine."

        "Question": "Which medication(s) affect appetite and nutrition in the older adult? (Select all that apply.)",
        "Choice 1": "Digoxin",
        "Choice 2": "Theophylline",
        "Choice 3": "Iron supplements",
        "Choice 4": "Aspirin",
        "Choice 5": "Phenergan",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 2, 3, 4",
        "Explanation": "Many medications affect appetite and nutrition, including digoxin, theophylline, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), iron supplements, antidepressants, and psychotropic medications. Clinically significant drug-nutrients interactions can result in nutrient loss, and evidence is accumulating that shows the use of nutritional supplements may counteract these possible drug-induced nutrient depletions. A thorough medication review is an essential component of nutritional assessment, and individuals should receive education about the effects of prescription medications, as well as herbals and supplements, on their nutritional status."

        "Question": "Which intervention(s) can be used to improve intake for individuals with dementia? (Select all that apply.)",
        "Choice 1": "Serve soup in a plastic bowl.",
        "Choice 2": "Use clear cups to serve drinks.",
        "Choice 3": "Cut up foods before serving.",
        "Choice 4": "Provide one utensil at a time.",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "2, 4",
        "Explanation": "Cutting food before serving decreases the risk for choking, as well as making it easier for patients to feed themselves. Soups should be served in a mug instead of a bowl to enable patients to hold the cup for ease of consuming. The use of red cups, not clear cups, has been shown to increase food intake. Providing one utensil at a time can often decrease confusion during meal time."
