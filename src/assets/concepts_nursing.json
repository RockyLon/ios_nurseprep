        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The HEADSS Adolescent Risk Profile is a psychosocial assessment screening tool which assesses home, education, activities, drugs, sex, and suicide for the purpose of identifying high-risk adolescents and the need for anticipatory guidance. It is used to identify high-risk, not low-risk, adolescents. Physical development is assessed with anthropometric data. Sexual development is assessed using physical examination."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The expected stage of development for a preschooler (3 to 4 years old) is preoperational. Concrete operational describes the thinking of a school-age child (7 to 11 years old). Formal operational describes the thinking of an individual after about 11 years of age. Sensorimotor describes the earliest pattern of thinking from birth to 2 years old."

        "Explanation": "Growth is a quantitative change in which an increase in cell number and size results in an increase in overall size or weight of the body or any of its parts. The processes by which early cells specialize are referred to as differentiation. Psychosocial and cognitive changes are referred to as development. Qualitative changes associated with aging are referred to as maturation."

        "Choice 4": "provides a framework for health teaching.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The Denver II is the most commonly used measure of developmental status used by health care professionals; it is a screening tool. Screening tools do not provide a diagnosis. Diagnosis requires a thorough neurodevelopment history and physical examination. Developmental delay, which is suggested by screening, is a symptom, not a diagnosis. The need for any therapy would be identified with a comprehensive evaluation, not a screening tool. Some providers use the Denver II as a framework for teaching about expected development, but this is not the primary purpose of the tool."

        "Choice 4": "nutrition.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Function is one of the concepts most significantly impacted by development. Others include sensory-perceptual, cognition, mobility, reproduction, and sexuality. Knowledge of these concepts can help the nurse anticipate areas that need to be addressed. Culture is a concept that is considered to significantly affect development; the difference is the concepts that affect development are those that represent major influencing factors (causes), hence determination of development and would be the focus of preventive interventions. Environment is considered to significantly affect development. Nutrition is considered to significantly affect development."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "By the end of the fourth year, it is expected that a child will engage in fantasy, so this is normal at this age. A referral to a psychologist would be premature based only on the complaint of the mother. Completing a developmental screening would be very appropriate but not the initial response. The nurse would certainly want to get more information, but separating the child from the mother is not necessary at this time."

        "Choice 4": "want to know everything.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Regression to an earlier stage of development is a common response to stress. Separation anxiety is most common in infants and toddlers. Rebellion against hospital rules is usually not an issue if the adolescent understands the rules and would not create childlike behaviors. An adolescent may want to “know everything” with their logical thinking and deductive reasoning, but that would not explain why they would act like a child."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Early colon cancer is often asymptomatic, with occult or frank blood in the stool being an assessment finding in a patient diagnosed with colon cancer. If pain is present, it is usually lower abdominal cramping. Constipation and diarrhea are more frequent findings than nausea or ascites."

        "Choice 4": "Limiting visitors, thus promoting the maximal amount of hours for sleep",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Pacing activities throughout the day conserves energy, and nursing care should be paced as well. Fatigue is a common side effect of cancer and treatment; and while adequate sleep is important, an increase in the number of hours slept will not resolve the fatigue. Restriction of visitors does not promote healthy coping and can result in feelings of isolation."

        "Explanation": "During the first 100 days after a bone marrow transplant, patients are at high risk for life-threatening infections. The earliest sign of infection in an immunosuppressed patient can be a mild fever. Mucositis, confusion, and depression are possible clinical manifestations but are representative of less life-threatening complications."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Postoperative deep breathing and coughing is important to promote oxygenation and clearing of secretions. Pain medications will be given to lessen pain and allow for deep breathing and coughing. Strict bed rest is not instituted, because early ambulation will help lessen postoperative complications such as deep vein thrombosis. Prolonged lying on the operative side is avoided."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "A comprehensive health history is vital to treating and caring for the patient. Often times, symptoms are vague.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "It is important to minimize stress and activities that could increase intracranial pressure. Combining many nursing activities could increase oxygen demand and intracranial pressure. This would not be safe. Interventions which can promote venous outflow can help decrease intracranial pressure. The stress of constipation or bowel movements can increase intracranial pressure; stool softeners or laxatives can minimize this."

        "Choice 3": "loss of primitive reflexes.",
        "Choice 4": "unequal pupil size.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "A change in level of consciousness is the earliest and most sensitive indication of a change in intracranial processing. This is assessed with the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), which assesses eye opening and verbal and motor response. The inability to focus may indicate a change, but it is not one of the earliest indicators or a component of the GCS. Primitive reflexes refers to those reflexes found in a normal infant that disappear with maturation. These reflexes may reappear with frontal lobe dysfunction and may be tested for with a suspected brain injury, so it would be the reappearance of primitive reflexes. A change in pupil size or unequal pupils may indicate a change, but they are not one of the earliest indicators or a component of the GCS."

        "Choice 4": "hypotension, and tachycardia.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Hypertension with widening pulse pressure, bradycardia, and respiratory changes are the ominous late signs of increased intracranial pressure and indications of impending herniation (Cushing's triad). It is bradycardia, not tachycardia, which is the component of this ominous triad. It is hypertension, not hypotension, which is the component of this ominous triad."

        "Choice 4": "verbal responsiveness.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Components of the GCS include eye opening, motor responsiveness, and verbal responsiveness. The nurse would want to assess the blood pressure, but this is not a component of the coma scale. Assessment of cranial nerve function is appropriate as alterations such as cranial nerve VI palsies may occur, but this is not part of the coma scale. Increases in head circumference are associated with alterations in intracranial pressure in infants, but this is not part of the coma scale."

Blood pressure control and exercising can decrease the risk of vascular disease, impacting the cerebral arteries, rather than head injuries. Smoking cessation is one primary prevention strategy which can decrease the risk of vascular disease. Maintaining a healthy weight can decrease the risk of vascular disease."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Anti-hypertensive medications may be detrimental because the mean arterial pressure must be adequate to maintain cerebral blood flow and limit secondary injury. Fever can worsen the outcome after a stroke, and antipyretics can promote normothermia. Osmotic diuretics such as mannitol can decrease interstitial volume and decrease intracranial pressure. Short-acting sedatives can decrease intracranial pressure by reducing metabolic demand. Long-acting sedatives would be avoided to provide times for periodic neurologic assessments."

This scale is an example of one type of specific tool for nurses to use when assessing a patient following stroke. The Monroe-Kellie doctrine is not an assessment or monitoring strategy; it describes the interrelationship of volume and compliance of the three cranial components, brain tissue, cerebral spinal fluid, and blood."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Elevation of total white cell count is indicative of inflammation that is often due to an infection. Upper respiratory infections are common problems in altering a patient's gas exchange. Eosinophil cells are increased in an allergic response. Neutrophils are more indicative of an acute inflammatory response. White cells do not assist to differentiate types of respiratory bacteria. Monocytes are an indicator of progress of a chronic infection."

        "Explanation": "Respiratory acidosis is caused by an increase in retention of carbon dioxide, regardless of the underlying disease. A decrease in carbon dioxide retention may lead to respiratory alkalosis. An increase in production of lactic acid leads to metabolic acidosis. Removal of an acid (gastric secretions) will lead to a metabolic alkalosis."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The INR of 4.8 is too high. The dosage of warfarin is adjusted to maintain an INR between 2 and 3. A level of 4.8 indicates that the patient is at risk for excessive bleeding. An INR of 1.8 is below the therapeutic range and would indicate the need for warfarin. APPT is not used to monitor effectiveness of the dose for warfarin."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The cilia in the tubes are stimulated by high estrogen levels, which propel the ovum toward the uterus. Without estrogen, the ovum won’t reach the uterus. The results of a series of events occurring in the ovary cause an expulsion of the oocyte from the ovarian follicle known as ovulation. The ovarian cycle is driven by multiple important hormones: 1) gonadotropic hormone, 2) follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and 3) luteinizing hormone (LH). The cilia in the tubes are stimulated by high 4) estrogen levels, which propel the ovum toward the uterus. The zona pellucida (inner layer) and corona radiata (outer layer) form protective layers around the ovum. If an ovum is not fertilized within 24 hours of ovulation by a sperm, it is usually reabsorbed into a woman’s body. A patient who is hypoestrogenic would not have excess circulating estrogen. A patient with low estrogen would not be classified as hyperestrogenic. Without sufficient estrogen, there can be no fertilization of the ovum."

This type of diagnostic maternal/fetal monitoring is performed to determine the best time for delivery due to potential fetal nutritional, circulatory, or pulmonary compromise. A cesarean section (operative delivery) may be performed if maternal or fetal conditions indicate that delivery is necessary. Antenatal diagnostics refers to prior to pregnancy.

Teratogenicity is a major concern because all external and internal structures are developing in the embryonic period. A pregnant woman should avoid exposure to all potential toxins during pregnancy, especially alcohol, tobacco, radiation, and infections during embryonic development. Living in a house beneath power lines is not the greatest implication in this patient’s plan of care as there are no definite risks to the developing fetus.

        "Choice 4": "the male condom.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "When used correctly, the male condom continues to be the single most effective method for preventing sexually transmitted diseases as well as being a very highly effective contraceptive agent. A significant primary prevention strategy is the recent introduction of a vaccine used to prevent cervical cancer and genital warts caused by HPV. One of two FDA-approved vaccines should be routinely administered to 11- and 12-year-old girls and can be given up to the age of 26. HIV screening is recommended for all sexually active teens by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Screening for existing disease is a secondary prevention strategy. By educating teens towards behavior change related to high-risk behaviors, nurses may be able to reduce the risk for contracting sexually transmitted infections."

        "Question": "Symptoms of sexual dysfunction and altered body image often coexist with prolapse of the female reproductive organs. Nursing care requires a great deal of sensitivity, because many women are embarrassed by their condition. Your patient is a 44-year-old married woman who is complaining of painful intercourse and incontinence. Clinical evaluation reveals that the patient has a cystocele. Which treatment option is most appropriate for this patient?",
        "Choice 1": "Pelvic floor training",
        "Choice 2": "Vaginal pessaries",
        "Choice 3": "Surgical correction",
        "Choice 4": "Lifestyle changes",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Depending on the cause, a cystocele can be readily corrected by surgery. Pelvic muscle floor training (Kegel exercises) will most definitely help with symptoms of urinary incontinence. This alone is not adequate treatment for this patient. Vaginal pessaries are an excellent treatment modality for uterine prolapse. Lifestyle changes such as weight loss, avoiding constipation, and reducing high-impact exercise, such as running, will all help the patient with pelvic organ prolapse. Although these modalities will provide relief, they will not correct the cystocele without surgical intervention."

        "Question": "Preventing infection remains the most effective way of reducing the adverse consequences of sexually transmitted infections, in particular those that are not readily curable. Nurses are often able to reassure the patient enough to open dialog regarding possible exposure, testing, and treatment options. When assessing high-risk behaviors, which question specifically identifies a blood-related risk?",
        "Choice 1": "\"Have you ever received donor semen, eggs, or transplanted tissue?\"",
        "Choice 2": "\"Have you ever exchanged sex for drugs, money, or shelter?\"",
        "Choice 3": "\"How do you protect yourself from HIV and sexually transmitted infections?\"",
        "Choice 4": "\"Have you ever injected drugs using shared equipment?\"",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Receipt of any donated organ, tissue, semen, or eggs is considered a blood-related risk. Other blood-related risks include blood transfusion, sex with a person with hemophilia, or sharing equipment for tattoos and body piercing. The exchange of sex for money, drugs, or shelter is considered a drug use–related risk. Other drug use–related risks include having sex with a person who uses or shares, and having sex while stoned, high, or drunk so that you cannot remember the details. By using male condoms, female condoms, or other barriers, patient can protect themselves against sexual risk. Other high-risk behaviors in this category include: having sex against one's will, failing to use protection, having sex with a partner who is bisexual or gay, having anal intercourse, and sexual activity with an increased number of partners. Sharing equipment to inject street drugs or steroids is a drug use–related risk."

        "Explanation": "The best predictor of sexual health is emotional well-being rather than the impairment of the physical aspects of sexual arousal and function. Nurses must remain cognizant that sexual dysfunction, regardless of the cause, is likely to result in a number of negative consequences including anxiety, stress, and depression. Although sexual arousal may be diminished by biological factors such as illness and hormone levels, psychologic factors such as anxiety, mood disorders, or stress play a more significant role in sexual health. Sexual dysfunction is more common in women, with 40 to 45% of women reporting symptoms as opposed to 20 to 30% of men.

If the immune response is functioning optimally, the body responds to the insult to the tissue by protecting the area from invasion of microorganisms and pathogens with inflammation. Routine vaccinations have no bearing on the body's response to intentional tissue impairment. The redness and swelling at the incision site in the first 12 to 24 hours is part of optimal immune functioning.

        "Explanation": "Immunosuppressant therapy is initiated to inhibit optimal immune response. This is necessary in the case of transplantation, because the normal immune response would cause the body to recognize the new tissue as foreign and attack it. The body will identify the new kidney as foreign and will not treat it as the original kidney. While patients with transplants must be careful about exposure to others, especially those who are or might be ill, and practice adequate and consistent infection control techniques, they don't have to avoid people or social interaction.

        "Choice 4": "late stage acute",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Elevated neutrophils and monocytes within normal limits are findings indicative of early inflammatory response. Neutrophils increase in just a few hours, while it takes the body days to increase the monocyte levels. Chronic inflammation results in varying elevations in WBCs dependent on multiple issues. Elevated neutrophils are not indicative of resolved inflammation. Elevations in monocytes occur later in the inflammatory response."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Avoidance of sharing personal items like razors and hairbrushes can decrease the spread of pathogens that cause inflammation and infection. Not eating with the others in his college apartment won't relieve or prevent the spread of infection. A CBC monthly will not treat or prevent inflammation. Showers should be disinfected before and after each use."

        "Explanation": "Broken or impaired skin creates a portal of entry for pathogens. By maintaining intact tissue, the patient and the nurse have broken the chain of infection by eliminating a portal of entry. Host is incorrect because you are not eliminating the person or organism. Intact tissue does not eliminate the mode of transmission. Skin can still be used to transfer pathogens regardless of it being intact or broken.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The patient with severe infection presents with low BP and compensating elevations in pulse to move lower volumes of blood more rapidly and respiration to increase access to oxygen. Urine output decreases to counteract the decreased circulating blood volume and hypotension. These vital signs are all too low: Blood pressure (BP) 92/52, pulse (P) 56 beats/min, respiratory rate (RR) 10 breaths/min, urine output 1200 mL in past 24 hours. The patient with severe infection does have a low BP, but the pulse and respiratory rate increase to compensate. This data is all within normal limits: BP 112/64, P 98 beats/min, RR 18 breaths/min, urine output 2400 mL in past 24 hours. This set of data reflects an elevated BP with a decrease in pulse and respiratory rates along with normal urine output: BP 152/90, P 52 beats/min, RR 12 breaths/min, urine output 4800 mL in past 24 hours. None of these is a typical response to severe infection."

        "Explanation": "People can transmit pathogens even if they don't currently feel ill. Some carriers never experience the full symptoms of a pathogen. Travelers may need different vaccinations when traveling to countries outside their own because of variations in prevalent microorganisms. Food and water supplies in foreign countries can contain microorganisms that will affect a body unaccustomed to their presence.

The nurse wants to protect visitors from exposure to the bacteria and protect the patient from secondary infection while immunocompromised, but the patient will need the support of family and close friends. Contact isolation precautions must be strictly followed along with the use of personal protective equipment and teaching on methods to inhibit transmission to help break the chain of infection. Intravenous fluids and strict intake and output monitoring will be important for the patient suffering the effects of Clostridium difficile, because it causes diarrhea with fluid loss."

Upon inspection, the nurse notices that Mrs. J has an open wound on the bottom of her foot, but the patient states she is not aware of this. The nurse interprets this response as",
        "Choice 1": "normal in the older adult.",
        "Choice 2": "a need for the patient to be evaluated for cognitive impairment.",
        "Choice 3": "a side effect of anti-hypertensive medication.",
        "Choice 4": "pathologic impairment of sensory responses.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Though at 57 she is borderline for \"older,\" this degree of sensory impairment at this age is not expected. Lack of sensation does not imply lack of knowledge, but rather decreased ability to perceive the stimuli. Anti-hypertensive medication does not typically cause decreased skin sensation. This is more common in antineoplastic drugs. Most likely Ms. J has diabetes, which is causing decreased sensation. The not feeling well is secondary to a change in blood sugar secondary to the wound response."

        "Explanation": "Neuropathic pain results from the abnormal processing of sensory input by the nervous system as a result of damage to the brain, spinal cord, or peripheral nerves. Simply put, neuropathic pain is pathologic. Examples of neuropathic pain include postherpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy, phantom pain, and post stroke pain syndrome.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Pain triggers a number of physiologic stress responses in the human body. Unrelieved pain can prolong the stress response and produce a cascade of harmful effects in all body systems. The stress response causes the endocrine system to release excessive amounts of hormones, such as cortisol, catecholamines, and glucagon. Insulin and testosterone levels decrease. Increased endocrine activity in turn initiates a number of metabolic processes, in particular, accelerated carbohydrate, protein, and fat destruction, which can result in weight loss, tachycardia, increased respiratory rate, shock, and even death. The immune system is also affected by pain as demonstrated by research showing a link between unrelieved pain and a higher incidence of nosocomial infections and increased tumor growth. Large tidal volumes are not associated with pain while decreased lung capacity is associated with unrelieved pain. Decreased tumor growth and longevity are not associated with unrelieved pain. Decreased carbohydrate, protein, and fat are not associated with pain or stress response."

All of the first-line analgesics used to manage pain are available in short-acting and long-acting formulations. For patients who have continuous pain, a long-acting analgesic, such as modified-release oral morphine, oxycodone, or hydromorphone, or transdermal fentanyl, is used to treat the persistent baseline pain. A fast-onset, short-acting analgesic (usually the same drug as the long-acting) is used to treat breakthrough pain if it occurs. When the oral route is not possible, such as in patients who cannot swallow or are NPO or nauseated, other routes of administration are used, including intravenous (IV), subcutaneous, transdermal, and rectal.

        "Choice 2": "\"In cases like yours, physical exercise works to elevate mood and reduce anxiety.\"",
        "Choice 3": "\"Reading about stress and how to manage it might be a good place to start.\"",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "In this case, the nurse lacks information about what stressors the patient is coping with or about what coping skills are already possessed. As a result, further assessment is indicated before potential solutions can be explored. Suggesting further exploration of the stress facing the patient is the only option that involves further assessment rather than suggesting a particular intervention."

        "Question": "A patient tells the nurse \"My doctor thinks my problems with stress relate to the negative way I think about things, and he wants me to learn a new way of thinking.\" Which response would be in keeping with the doctor's recommendations?",
        "Choice 1": "Teaching the patient to recognize, reconsider, and reframe irrational thoughts",
        "Choice 2": "Encouraging the patient to imagine being in calming circumstances",
        "Choice 3": "Teaching the patient to use instruments that give feedback about bodily functions",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Cognitive reframing focuses on recognizing and correcting maladaptive patterns of thinking that create stress or interfere with coping. Cognitive reframing involves recognizing the habit of thinking about a situation or issue in a fixed, irrational, and unquestioning manner. Helping the patient to recognize and reframe (reword) such thoughts so that they are realistic and accurate promotes coping and reduces stress. Thinking about being in calming circumstances is a form of guided imagery. Instruments that give feedback about bodily functions are used in biofeedback. Journaling is effective for helping to increase self-awareness. However, none of these last three interventions is likely to alter the patient's manner of thinking."

He will return to the clinic for follow-up evaluation in 2 weeks. Which data will best suggest that the patient is successfully using these techniques to cope more effectively with stress?",
        "Choice 1": "The patient's wife reports that he spends more time sitting quietly at home.",
        "Choice 2": "He reports that his appetite, mood, and energy levels are all good.",
        "Choice 3": "His systolic blood pressure has gone from the 140s to the 120s (mm Hg).",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Objective measures tend to be the most reliable means of gauging progress. In this case, the patient's elevated blood pressure, an indication of the body's physiologic response to stress, has diminished. The wife's observations regarding his activity level are subjective, and his sitting quietly could reflect his having given up rather than improved. Appetite, mood, and energy levels are also subjective reports that do not necessarily reflect physiologic changes from stress and may not reflect improved coping with stress. The patient's report that he feels better and is not bothered as much by his circumstances could also reflect resignation rather than improvement."

        "Explanation": "Adolescents with poor coping have increased risk for drug and alcohol use, risky sexual behaviors, and suicide. Pulse, respiratory rate, and blood pressure may change during stress, but patient safety is the priority concern. Adolescents may have inaccurate perceptions of stressors, and this actually increases the risk for unsafe behaviors.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The best action by the nurse is to help the patient develop an action plan to assess what resources may already be available to meet responsibilities at home. A long absence from the home on a rehabilitation unit does not address the immediate need to provide care for the disabled family member. An ambulance transfer to another family member is premature until the placement is identified as an appropriate placement based on the disabled person's needs, availability to provide the care by another, and distance of the transfer. Assessing the patient's needs after discharge does not address the immediate need to provide care for the disabled family person."

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Seeing a response to antidepressants takes 3 to 6 weeks. No change in medications is indicated at this point of treatment because there is no report of adverse effects from the medication. If nausea is present, taking the medication with food may help, but this is not reported by the patient, so a change in administration time is not needed.

        "Choice 2": "Discuss how divorce support groups could increase coping and social support.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "High-quality social support enhances mental and physical health and acts as a significant buffer against distress. Low-quality support relationships are known to affect a person's coping effectiveness negatively. Resuming dating soon after a divorce could place additional stress on the patient rather than helping them cope with existing stressors. Developing relationships on the Internet probably would not substitute fully for direct contact with other humans and could expose the patient to predators misrepresenting themselves to take advantage of vulnerable persons."

        "Choice 1": "\"What kinds of things do you do to reduce or cope with your stress?\"",
        "Choice 2": "\"Tell me about your family history—do any relatives have problems with stress?\"",
        "Choice 3": "\"Tell me about exercise—how far do you typically run when you go jogging?\"",
        "Choice 4": "\"Stress can interfere with sleep. How much did you sleep last night?\"",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The most important data to collect during an initial assessment is that which reflects how stress is affecting the patient and how he is coping with stress at present. This data would indicate whether his distress is placing him in danger (e.g., by elevating his blood pressure dangerously or via maladaptive responses such as drinking) and would help you understand how he copes and how well his coping strategies and resources are serving him. Therefore, of the choices presented, the highest priority would be to determine what he is doing to cope at present, preferably via an open-ended or broad-opening inquiry. Family history, the extent of his use of exercise, and how much sleep he is getting are all helpful but seek data that is less of a priority. Also, the manner in which such data is sought here is likely to provide only brief responses (e.g., how much sleep he got on one particular night is probably less important than how much he is sleeping in general)."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Older homes frequently have lead-based paint; paint chips generated by remodeling put toddlers, who often put foreign objects in their mouths, at risk for exposure to lead which is a known toxic substance that can affect cognitive function. Powdered formulas, attendance at play groups, or riding on a school bus are not known to impair cognitive development."

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Anti-hypertensives such as the beta-blockers can cause adverse changes in cognition. While an infection can affect cognition, antibiotics do not generally cause cognitive changes. The cholinesterase inhibitors are prescribed to slow the progression in cognitive decline for patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Bisphosphonates are used for osteoporosis and are not generally a risk for altered cognition."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Patients with a cognitive impairment benefit from a predictable routine and consistent caregivers. Trips off of the unit may confuse the patient and disrupt their normal routine. Offering too many selections causes confusion and can lead to agitation. Being in large groups for activities can overstimulate the patient and lead to agitation and fear."

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The confusion caused by an underlying medical condition is a temporary condition that can be corrected once the underlying condition is treated, in this case once the patient is rehydrated. It is not necessary to teach home care or make a referral to home health because it is not expected that the patient will be confused at discharge. Telling the daughter that there is nothing to worry about diminishes her concern and may decrease her trust in the nurse."

        "Explanation": "Having a night light on for the patient can help orient them to their surroundings. Having the flickering light and sound from a television will not help a confused patient remain calm or oriented. Restraining a patient will increase their agitation and actually increase their risk of injury if they try to get out of bed. Sleeping medications often increase confusion in cognitively impaired patients."

        "Explanation": "Medications such as narcotics, hypertensives, sleeping meds, and others can cause disorientation and symptoms of delirium. The death of a spouse is more likely to cause depression than disorientation. A history of diabetes alone does not cause disorientation. Normal aging alone does not cause disorientation, although it is a risk factor."

Not using chemical substances, wearing a helmet, and wearing a seat belt are all measures to prevent injury to the brain, which protects cognitive function. An MMSE and CAM are secondary prevention, or screening tools performed once symptoms are present.

        "Explanation": "The clinical manifestations of an opioid overdose include seizures, shock, respiratory depression, dysrhythmias, and altered level of consciousness. An opioid overdose is a medical emergency. Amphetamine overdose is ruled out because it causes hypertension and central nervous system disturbances such as paranoia, panic, and delusions. LSD overdose would also manifest with hypertension and tachypnea along with hallucinations and possible loss of contact with reality. Travel outside the country is unrelated."

        "Explanation": "Providing education that will address immediate safety needs for the patient is a priority action for the nurse. The nurse is not creating a plan for the perpetrator, nor is it the responsibility of the victim to receive medication for another person. Self-defense training does not meet the immediate safety concern for the patient and may aggravate the perpetrator further. Accessing support from a religious advisor is good for ongoing support, but it does not address the immediate need for safety information."

When the nurse enters the room, the patient is sitting in the chair with her head down, rocking back and forth, does not make eye contact, and answers questions with no expression on her face. What assessment question would be important for the nurse to ask the patient?",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "This patient is exhibiting signs of being abused. It is important to ask about the safety of the patient. General questions about her visit do not give an opportunity for the patient to discuss her safety needs.

The patient states, \"I don't see any way to get away from my partner, and I can't keep going on like this.\" What assessment question is most important for the nurse to ask?",
        "Choice 1": "\"Do you have any family in the area that can help?\"",
        "Choice 2": "\"Have you thought about hurting yourself or someone else?\"",

        "Explanation": "Depression and an increased risk of suicide are common outcomes from individuals experiencing interpersonal violence. It is critical that the nurse specifically assess for the risk of harm to the patient or to others during assessment. Asking if family or friends are available for support is good, but it is more important to assess for the safety concern of suicide or harm to others. It is not helpful to ask if a person who has stated that they don't see a way out has thought of leaving—their comment indicates that they can't see any solution. This situation is a high risk for suicide, or even homicide against the perpetrator."

        "Explanation": "Abused persons return to abusive settings because they feel they have no other options or they fear reprisal from the abusive partner.

The ANA is the professional organization of registered nursing in the United States and may influence, but it does not regulate. The IOM collaborated with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to improve the fractured health care system in the United States, and it makes recommendations, not rules.

Attending nursing educational meetings can promote collaborative learning with peers and maintenance of competence in an ever-changing health care environment. Listening can promote professionalism, and communication is certainly a component of professionalism; however, there is also a social sense to listening, and without the educational/learning component, this is not the best answer.

The national Gallup poll has found nursing to be one of the most trusted professions for their honesty and ethical standards almost every year, but it does not outline expectations. Emma Goldman was a radical anarchist nurse who advocated and cared for indigent women in New York. She demonstrated the expectations of a professional nurse.

Reflection also considers evaluating the result of the actions to determine whether they were effective. Although critiquing ideas and establishing goal-oriented care could be considered part of a generalized statement of critical thinking, this is not broad enough without the reflection and evaluation. Clinical judgment would most likely be used to create care paths derived from the evidence; however, this is not the cornerstone of the Tanner Model.

        "Type": "Single",

        "Explanation": "Responding entails adjusting the plan of care to the particular patient issue through one or more nursing interventions. In this case, the nurse is working with the patient's wishes, knowing that the patient will most likely cheat. The patient will be allowed to \"cheat.\" The plan will be evaluated to be sure the snack does not elevate the glucose excessively and be readjusted if warranted. While it is true that most chocolate has a high glycemic index, providing a list of foods that do not include the one thing the patient enjoys will most likely lead to nonadherence to the diet. Advising the patient that they can have whatever they want to eat may lead to further dietary indiscretions and cause side effects such as obesity or high glucose readings. Knowledge Deficit is an inaccurate diagnosis for this patient as evidenced by the patient stating they understand the need to exercise and the need to diet."

Assessment data may at times be difficult to obtain, but that would not occur often enough to warrant a warning about the difficulty in charting it.

        "Question": "A home care nurse receives a physician order for a medication that the patient does not want to take because the patient has a history of side effects from this medication. The nurse carefully listens to the patient, considers it in light of the patient's condition, questions its appropriateness, and examines alternative treatments. This nurse would most likely",
        "Choice 1": "call the physician, explain rationale, and suggest a different medication.",
        "Choice 2": "consult an experienced nurse on whether there are other similar treatments.",
        "Choice 3": "hold the drug until the physician returns to the unit and can be questioned.",
        "Choice 4": "question other staff as to the physician's acceptance of nursing input.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Determining how best to proceed on behalf of a patient's best health care outcomes may require clinical judgment. At the committed level of critical thinking, the nurse chooses an action after all possibilities have been examined. A home care nurse who is using good clinical judgment techniques should have confidence in their decision and may not have another nurse available as this is an autonomous setting. Holding the drug might jeopardize the patient's health, so this is not the best solution. The nurse working at this level of critical thinking makes choices based on careful examination of situations and alternatives; whether or not the physician is open to nursing input is not relevant."

        "Question": "A patient has been admitted for a skin graft following third degree burns to the bilateral calves. The plan of care involves 3 days inpatient and 6 months outpatient treatment, to include home care and dressing changes. When should the nurse initiate the educational plan?",
        "Choice 1": "After the operation and the patient is awake",
        "Choice 2": "On admission, along with the initial assessment",
        "Choice 3": "The day before the patient is to be discharged",
        "Choice 4": "When narcotics are no longer needed routinely",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Initial discharge planning begins upon admission. After the operation has been completed is too late to begin the discharge planning process. The day before discharge is too late for the nurse to gather all pertinent information and begin teaching and coordinating resources. After a complicated operation, the patient may well be discharged on narcotic analgesics. Waiting for the patient to not need them anymore might mean the patient gets discharged without teaching being done."

        "Question": "A nurse has designed an individualized nursing care plan for a patient, but the patient is not meeting goals. Further assessment reveals that the patient is not following through on many items. Which action by the nurse would be best for determining the cause of the problem?",
        "Choice 1": "Assess whether the actions were too hard for the patient.",
        "Choice 2": "Determine whether the patient agrees with the care plan.",
        "Choice 3": "Question the patient's reasons for not following through.",
        "Choice 4": "Reevaluate data to ensure the diagnoses are sound.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Having patient and/or family provide input to the care plan is vital in order to gain support for the plan of action. The actions may have been too difficult for the patient, but this is a very narrow item to focus on. The nurse might want to find out the rationale for the patient not following through, but instead of directly questioning the patient, which can sound accusatory, it would be best to offer some possible motives. Reevaluation should be an ongoing process, but the more likely cause of the patient's failure to follow through is that the patient did not participate in making the plan of care."

        "Question": "A GN appears to be second-guessing herself and is constantly calling on the other nurses to double-check their plan of care or rehearse what they will say to the doctor before she call on the patient's behalf. This seems to be annoying some of the nurse's coworkers. The nurse manager's best response to this situation is to",
        "Choice 1": "explain to coworkers that this is a characteristic of critical thinking and is important for the GN to improve reasoning skills.",
        "Choice 2": "agree with the staff and have someone follow and work more closely with a preceptor.",
        "Choice 3": "have a talk with the nurse and suggest asking fewer questions.",
        "Choice 4": "tell the staff that all new nurses go through this phase, and ignore their behavior.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Reflection-on-action is critical for development of knowledge and improvement in reasoning. It is where learning from practice is incorporated into experience. Inquisitiveness is a characteristic of critical thinking and reflects a desire to learn even when the knowledge may not appear readily useful. The manager should promote this. Suggesting the nurse work more closely with a preceptor implies that the manager thinks the nurse needs to learn more and increase confidence. In reality, this nurse is demonstrating a characteristic of critical thinking. Suggesting that the nurse ask fewer questions would hamper the development of the nurse as a critical thinker. All new nurses do go through a phase of asking more questions at one time, but dismissing the nurse's behavior with this explanation is simplistic and will discourage critical thinking."

        "Question": "A nurse has committed a serious medication error and has reported their error to the hospital's adverse medication error hotline as well as to the unit manager. The manager is a firm believer in developing critical thinking skills. From this standpoint, what action by the manager would best nurture this ability in the nurse who made the error?",
        "Choice 1": "Have the nurse present an in-service related to the cause of the error.",
        "Choice 2": "Instruct the nurse to write a paper on how to avoid this type of error.",
        "Choice 3": "Let the nurse work with more experienced nurses when giving medications.",
        "Choice 4": "Send the nurse to refresher courses on medication administration.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Nurturing critical thinking skills is done in part by turning errors into learning opportunities. If the nurse presents an in-service on the cause and prevention of the type of error committed, not only will the nurse learn something but many others nurses on the unit will learn from it to. This is the best example of developing critical thinking skills. This option would allow the nurse to learn from the mistake, which is a method of developing critical thinking skills, but the paper would benefit only the nurse, so this option is not the best choice. Letting the nurse work with more experienced nurses might be a good option in a very limited setting, for example, if the nurse is relatively new and the manager discovers a deficiency in the nurse's orientation or training on giving medications in that system. Otherwise, this option would not really be beneficial. Sending the nurse to refresher courses might be a solution, but it is directed at the nurse's learning, not critical thinking. The nurse might feel resentful at having to attend such classes, but even if they were helpful, only this one nurse is learning. Going to generic classes also does not address the specific reason this error occurred, and thus might be irrelevant. Critical thinking and learning can be enhanced by a presentation to the staff on the causes of the error."

        "Choice 3": "Journaling is a way to organize your thoughts about your experiences.",
        "Choice 4": "Journaling teaches open-mindedness, a critical thinking disposition.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Critical thinking requires reflection on what occurred, how data were processed, and how decisions were made. Journaling is one method of developing critical thinking skills. Journaling does give nurses time to review what happened in their clinical, but this statement does not go far enough in explaining the importance of the journal-writing process. Journaling may be a way to organize thoughts about one's experiences, but this statement is too narrow an explanation and does not account for the critical aspect of reflection. Open-mindedness is a critical thinking disposition that allows one to be tolerant of divergent views. Journaling can assist with developing this disposition, but only if what is written reflects that specific topic."

        "Explanation": "Informal teaching is individualized one-on-one teaching which represents the majority of patient education done by nurses that occurs when an intervention is explained or a question is answered. Group needs are often the focus of formal patient education courses or classes. Informal teaching does not necessarily follow a specific formalized plan. It may be planned with specific content, but it is individualized responses to patient needs. Formal teaching involves the use of a curriculum/course plan with standardized content."

Family resources would be considered in developing a plan of care and could be an asset or a barrier to patient education. The patient's educational level would be considered in planning teaching strategies but would not be a barrier to education.

        "Explanation": "An instructional video would provide a visual/auditory approach for discharge instructions. Repeatedly not following written instructions is a clue that the patient may not be able to read or understand the information. While assessing the literacy level of an adult patient can be challenging, the information that they have not been able to follow previous written instructions would suggest that the nurse use an alternate strategy that does not require a high degree of literacy. An individualized handout would be written, very similar to previous instructions, and would not address a concern about literacy. Internet resources generally require an individual to be able to read, and although videos are available through the Internet, this is not the best response. Self-help books would be appropriate for an individual who reads. There is a question about whether this patient is literate, so these would not be the best choice."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "A survey or questionnaires can be used to measure affective behavior change as well as patient satisfaction with the teaching experience. Observing for level of skill mastery would evaluate achievement of a psychomotor goal rather than satisfaction with the experience. Repeating information more than one time or in more than one way may be appropriate strategies to include in the teaching plan but would provide no evaluation data. Providing for a return demonstration would help in evaluating achievement of a psychomotor goal, not satisfaction with the activity."

Shenjeng sharo refers to “weakness of nerves” in Chinese culture; it is caused by a decrease in vital energy that reduces the function of the internal organ systems and lowers resistance to disease.

The patient from a collectivist culture will usually consult family members for a best course of action. It is not acceptable for nurses to take it upon themselves to call the recognized elder or oldest male relative for help with decision making.

        "Choice 2": "Shared governance collaboration",
        "Choice 3": "Interorganizational collaboration",
        "Choice 4": "Mentoring collaboration",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Mentoring is a collaborative partnership between a novice nurse and an expert nurse to help transition a nurse through career development, personal growth, and socialization into the profession. Interprofessional collaboration is working with several disciplines. Shared governance is a type of management for nursing. Interorganizational collaboration often includes teams from inside and outside an organization to meet a common goal."

        "Question": "The nurse is presenting an in-service on the importance of collaborative communication. The nurse includes which critical event identified by the Joint Commission as an outcome of poor communication among health care team members?",
        "Choice 1": "The occurrence of a patient event resulting in death or serious injury",
        "Choice 2": "Decreased ability to document expenses of care provided",

        "Choice 4": "Increased time to discharge patients to outpatient care",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The Joint Commission has identified that poor communication is the primary factor in the occurrence of sentinel events, or events resulting in unintended death or serious injury to patients. Lack of documentation, longer time to begin surgery, and increased delays in discharge all contribute to the management of health care, but do not result in critical patient outcomes."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Professional collaboration includes team management and referral to needed providers to meet patient needs. Each discipline retains responsibility for their own scope of practice but recognizes the expertise of other providers. Working separately does not develop a comprehensive plan of care. Casual mentioning of patient needs does not follow professional communication channels and frequently delays needed interventions."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Lateral violence undermines collaboration and occurs nurse-to-nurse. Vertical or descending violence implies one participant has a higher status than another. Personal violence falls in a legal category, and while it will hinder collaboration, it is not specific to coworkers."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The patient needs to be the focus of developing care plans, and communication is an important part of collaboration with the patient to discover barriers for the patient to follow recommendations. It is important to either provide solutions to the barriers or present other options. Reviewing the care again does not demonstrate willingness to have the patient be part of the team. Insisting that the patient do what is prescribed is autocratic and does not recognize the role the patient has in their care. Leaving the patient and spouse with the situation unresolved fosters distrust and more anger."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "To honor the patient's request to stay at home the nurse should make appropriate referrals for needed evaluation and assistance. Most nurses will not have the expertise to teach appropriate exercises for degenerative illness. Asking the patient to move to an assisted-living facility does not account for the patient's request. The patient has not been assessed for the need of daily therapy, and it is not likely that a patient with a degenerative illness will be able to make daily appointments for treatment as the illness progresses."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Treatment plans need to be developed, evaluated, and adapted as needed based on the patient status and willingness to complete the prescribed care. Stating that the patient has to do whatever the care provider prescribes does not include the principle of collaboration. Care plans can be altered based on patient status. Insurance providers do not determine a patient's ability to complete prescribed care, although they do reimburse for standard care given."

        "Explanation": "Recognizing that collaboration needs all professions to provide patient-centered care is an important first step to implementing a different philosophy in the hospital. Posting an evaluation of performance before education will not encourage participation. Collaboration requires an understanding of more than your own discipline. It is unfair to evaluate staff on a requirement that they have not been introduced to."

        "Explanation": "Nurses should include patients and their families when exploring health promotion activities, end-of-life decisions, lifestyle changes, and treatment options. Prescribed medication doses are initiated by educated professionals, although the patient gives feedback on the effectiveness of medications. Patients are not trained to interpret lab results, but patients rely on health professionals to explain results to them."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "A sentinel event is an unexpected occurrence involving death or serious physical or psychologic injury or the risk thereof called sentinel, because they signal the need for immediate investigation and response. A near-miss refers to an error or commission or omission that could have harmed the patient, but serious harm did not occur as a result of chance. Harm that relates to an underlying disease or condition provides the rationale for the close monitoring and supervision provided in a health care setting. An adverse event is one that results in unintended harm because of the commission or omission of an act."

        "Explanation": "The nurse avoided a treatment error, giving the wrong medication. Benazepril is an ace inhibitor used to treat blood pressure. According to Leape, treatment errors occur in the performance of an operation, procedure, or test; in administering a treatment; in the dose or method of administering a drug; or in avoidable delay in treatment or in responding to an abnormal test. Communication errors refer to those that occur from a failure to communicate. Diagnostic errors are the result of a delay in diagnosis, failure to employ indicated tests, use of outmoded tests, or failure to act on results of monitoring or testing. Preventive errors occur when there is inadequate monitoring or failure to provide prophylactic treatment or follow-up of treatment."

        "Choice 4": "tallman lettering.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Tallman lettering is a term coined by ISMP to describe the practice of using unique letter characteristics of similar drug names known to have been confused with one another. Tallman lettering is used to differentiate products with look-alike names such as BenaDRYL (antihistamine) and BenaZEPRIL (ace inhibitor). The other options are examples of safety-enhancing technologies strategies designed to minimize drug errors, but they are not directed at look-alike medications. Automatic alerts are computer-generated alarms that can be programmed to occur with such things as allergies and incompatible medications. Bar coding is used with medication administration systems that can be programmed to match patient identification bracelets with documentation.

        "Explanation": "The right route (e.g., oral or intramuscular) is an essential component to verify prior to the administration of any drug. The patient does not need to be in a specific location. There may be a number of physicians caring for a patient who prescribe medications for any given patient. A similar drug may be made by a number of different companies, and checking the manufacturer is not considered one of the seven rights.

Through a strategy such as root cause analysis the reasons for errors in medication administration can be identified and strategies developed to minimize future occurrences. Requiring continued education may be an appropriate recommendation but not until data is collected about the event.

A safety culture requires organizational leadership (e.g., the nurse manager) that gives attention to human factors such as managing workload fluctuations. This strategy also applies principles of crew resource management in that it addresses workload distribution. Lack of supplies can create a challenge for safe care but could not be addressed with the schedule. Concerns with communication and coordination across disciplines, including power gradients, and excessive professional courtesy can create hazards but would not be the best answer.

        "Question": "One of the first nurse researchers to document evidence-based practice for nursing was Florence Nightingale. What did Nightingale incorporate into her practice that made her practice different from her colleagues?",
        "Choice 1": "Nightingale gathered scientific data.",
        "Choice 2": "Nightingale calculated statistics to report her findings.",
        "Choice 3": "Nightingale communicated her findings to powerful others.",
        "Choice 4": "Nightingale based her nursing practice on her findings.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Florence Nightingale had tried to develop the role of researcher by using evidence from her practice and implementing these findings. Evidence-based practice (EBP) includes conducting quality studies, synthesizing the study findings into the best research evidence available, and using that research evidence effectively in practice. Although gathering scientific data, calculating statistics to report findings, and communicating findings to powerful others are all important components of conducting research, Nightingale's action that most appropriately reflects the current nursing research priority is that she based her nursing practice on her findings."

        "Explanation": "A controlled study is a type of quantitative research that seeks to control and examine the variables to determine effectiveness. In this case, the variables would be those that were administered tramadol (Ultracet) and those that were administered hydrochloride and acetaminophen (Percocet) for managing back pain. Correlational research methods help determine association between or among variables. A longitudinal study examines variables over a designated course of time. A systematic reviews/meta-analysis is a type of literature review and not a research method. A survey study is a type of qualitative research method."

        "Explanation": "The triggers addressed within the Iowa model process can be problem focused and evolve from risk management data, process improvement data, benchmarking data, financial data, and clinical problems. The triggers can also be knowledge focused, such as new research findings, change in a national agency's or an organization's standards and guidelines, expanded philosophy of care, or questions from the institutional standards committee. Because the Iowa model is often implemented at a fairly high level of nursing or hospital administration, it scrutinizes the input of nursing and other disciplines in its process. Its output is applied as widely as possible throughout the organization, and it can affect policy within a multihospital system and even across systems.

        "Explanation": "The Iowa model of EBP provides direction for the development of EBP in a clinical agency. This EBP model was initially developed in 1994 and revised in 2001. In a health care agency, there are triggers that initiate the need for change, and the focus should always be to make changes based on best evidence. These triggers can be problem focused and evolve from risk management data, process improvement data, benchmarking data, financial data, and clinical problems. The triggers can also be knowledge focused, such as new research findings, change in a national agency's or an organization's standards and guidelines, expanded philosophy of care, or questions from an institutional standards committee."

To palliate is to reduce the severity of an actual or potential life-threatening condition or a chronic debilitating illness. Palliation is not equivalent to cure, but it is the reduction of undesirable effects resulting from the incurable disease or condition."

Good attendance at a work-sponsored function indicates that staff enjoy interacting and are meeting social and relationship roles. Separating disciplines does not foster a sense of team. Moving administration away from staff limits interaction and informal conversations that build trust.

        "Explanation": "Including staff at all levels of an organization in planning and projects demonstrates respect for the intelligence and creativity of the individual. Requiring advanced education for any advancement limits those with barriers to attending additional schooling; advancement should be available in a variety of ways to show the value of the individual. Committees that only consist of upper management cause a feeling of disconnect between staff and administration.

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "There are significant problems in an organization where staff are not willing to openly discuss problems, especially problems that affect patient care. A focus group can help identify what is preventing a sense of comfort to reveal problems. Scheduling a meeting is unlikely to have the person admit to complaining about care provided by coworkers in front of coworkers. A request to review policies and procedures is so broad the staff will not be able to identify a specific problem that needs to be corrected. Unless organizational changes are made, it is unlikely that staff will decide to come forward when they would not do so in the first place."

        "Explanation": "In an economic climate where hospitals are not hiring, nursing schools may limit enrollment which will limit the availability of future nurses available to be hired when the current nurses retire or reduce their hours. Salary savings is minimal as the number of patients, staffing, and revenue are closely aligned. Scholarships will decrease as hiring commitments to scholarship holders will no longer be in effect.

The elderly are a large part of the population, but that does not change the economics of health care. Everyone does not have health insurance, so that statement would not enter into health care economics. Last, all health care dollars are not partitioned by the government; third party payers exist."

        "Explanation": "A patient with decompensated heart failure has extracellular fluid volume (ECV) excess. The IV of 0.9% NaCl is normal saline, which should be questioned because it would expand ECV and place an additional load on the failing heart. Diuretics such as furosemide are appropriate to decrease the ECV during heart failure. Increasing the potassium intake with KCl is appropriate, because furosemide increases potassium excretion. Oxygen administration is appropriate in this situation of near pulmonary edema from ECV excess."

        "Explanation": "Positive Chvostek's sign indicates increased neuromuscular excitability, which can progress to dangerous laryngospasm or seizures and thus needs to be reported first. The other assessment findings are less urgent and need further assessment. Bilateral ankle edema is a sign of ECV excess, and follow-up is needed, but the situation is not immediately life-threatening. Dry mucous membranes in a patient taking a diuretic may be associated with ECV deficit; however, additional assessments of ECV deficit are required before reporting to the physician. Constipation has many causes, including hypercalcemia and opioid analgesics, and it needs action, but not as urgently as a positive Chvostek's sign."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Administering IV potassium to a patient who has oliguria is not safe, because potassium intake faster than potassium output can cause hyperkalemia with dangerous cardiac dysrhythmias. Dry mucous membranes, skin tenting, and blood pressure 98/58 are consistent with the need for IV 0.9% NaCl. Weight gain of 2 pounds in a week does not necessarily indicate fluid overload, because it can be from increased nutritional intake. Only an overnight weight gain indicates a fluid gain."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "ADH causes renal reabsorption of water, which dilutes the body fluids. Excessive ADH thus causes hyponatremia. Excessive aldosterone causes ECV excess rather than hyponatremia. The posterior pituitary gland releases ADH; lack of ADH causes hypernatremia. Vomiting without fluid replacement causes ECV deficit and hypernatremia."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Tube feedings pose a risk for hypernatremia unless adequate water is administered between tube feedings. Hypernatremia causes the level of consciousness to decrease. The serum sodium concentration is a laboratory measure for osmolality imbalances, not ECV imbalances. Edema is a sign of ECV excess, not hypernatremia.

        "Explanation": "Chronic diarrhea has high risk of causing ECV deficit, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia because it increases fecal excretion of sodium-containing fluid, potassium, calcium, and magnesium. Appropriate assessments include postural blood pressure and heart rate for ECV deficit; weaker leg muscles than usual for hypokalemia; and positive Trousseau's sign for hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia. Bilateral ankle edema is a sign of ECV excess, which is not likely with chronic diarrhea. Flat neck veins when upright is a normal finding.

        "Explanation": "ECV deficit is characterized by skin tenting; rapid, thready pulse; and flat neck veins when supine, which can be assessed in this patient. Although ECV deficit also causes postural blood pressure drop with tachycardia, this assessment is not appropriate for a patient with recent bilateral, above-the-knee amputations.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Diarrhea causes metabolic acidosis through loss of bicarbonate, which is a base. Eating less sodium during diarrhea increases the risk of ECV deficit. Although diarrhea does remove fluid from the body, it also removes sodium and bicarbonate which need to be replaced. Rapid deep respirations are the compensatory mechanism for metabolic acidosis and should be encouraged rather than stopped."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Type B COPD is a chronic disease that causes impaired excretion of carbonic acid, thus causing respiratory acidosis, with PaCO2 high and pH low. This chronic disease exists long enough for some renal compensation to occur, manifested by high HCO3-. Answers that include low or normal bicarbonate are not correct, because the renal compensation for respiratory acidosis involves excretion of more hydrogen ions than usual, with retention of bicarbonate in the blood. High pH occurs with alkalosis, not acidosis."

        "Explanation": "Thyroid hormone increases metabolic rate, causing a patient with severe hyperthyroidism to have high risk of metabolic acidosis from increased production of metabolic acids.

        "Explanation": "Oliguria decreases the excretion of metabolic acids and is a risk factor for metabolic acidosis. Jaundice requires follow-up but is not an acid-base problem.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Decreasing an insulin dose by half creates high risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, and this patient has the highest priority. The other patients have less priority due to lower risk situations with longer time course before development of an acid-base imbalance. The coughing when dogs are near is not a sign of a severe asthma episode that causes respiratory acidosis, although this patient does need attention after the insulin situation is handled. Disposing of morphine properly helps prevent respiratory acidosis from opioid overdose. Guidance regarding weight loss helps prevent starvation ketoacidosis."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "2, 3, 4",
        "Explanation": "Taking insulin as prescribed helps prevent diabetic ketoacidosis. Safeguarding aspirin from children prevents metabolic acidosis from increased acid intake. Regular dialysis reduces the risk of metabolic acidosis from decreased renal excretion of metabolic acid. Baking soda is sodium bicarbonate and should not be used as an antacid due to the risk of metabolic alkalosis. Fasting without carbohydrate intake is a risk factor for starvation ketoacidosis."

        "Question": "Strategies to include in a community program for senior citizens related to dealing with cold winter temperatures would include",
        "Choice 1": "avoiding hot beverages.",
        "Choice 2": "shopping at an indoor mall.",
        "Choice 3": "using a fan at low speed.",
        "Choice 4": "walking slowly in the park.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Shopping indoors where there is protection from the elements and temperature control is one strategy to avoid cold temperatures. Hot beverages can help an individual deal with cold weather. Avoiding breezes and air currents is recommended to conserve body temperature. Physical activity can increase body temperature, and if the senior is going to walk in the park, weather-appropriate (warm) clothing and a usual or brisk pace, not a slow pace, would be recommended."

        "Question": "During orientation to an emergency department, the nurse educator would be concerned if the new nurse listed which of the following as a risk factor for impaired thermoregulation?",
        "Choice 1": "Impaired cognition",
        "Choice 2": "Occupational exposure",
        "Choice 3": "Physical agility",
        "Choice 4": "Temperature extremes",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Physical agility is not a risk factor for impaired thermoregulation. The nurse educator would use this information to plan additional teaching to include medical conditions and gait disturbance as risk factors for hypothermia, because their bodies have a reduced ability to generate heat. Impaired cognition is a risk factor. Recreational or occupational exposure is a risk factor. Temperature extremes are risk factors for impaired thermoregulation."

        "Question": "The most appropriate measure for a nurse to use in assessing core body temperature when there are suspected problems with thermoregulation is a(n)",
        "Choice 1": "oral thermometer.",
        "Choice 2": "rectal thermometer.",
        "Choice 3": "temporal thermometer scan.",
        "Choice 4": "tympanic membrane sensor.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The most reliable means available for assessing core temperature is a rectal temperature, which is considered the standard of practice. An oral temperature is a common measure but not the most reliable. A temporal thermometer scan has some limitations and is not the standard. The tympanic membrane sensor could be used as a second source for temperature assessment."

        "Question": "The nurse planning care for a patient with hypothermia would consider knowledge of similar exemplars including",
        "Choice 1": "heat exhaustion.",
        "Choice 2": "heat stroke.",
        "Choice 3": "infection.",
        "Choice 4": "prematurity.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Prematurity, frost bite, environmental exposure, and brain injury are considered exemplars of hypothermia. Heat exhaustion is an exemplar of hyperthermia. Heat stroke is an exemplar of hyperthermia. Infection is an exemplar of hyperthermia."
