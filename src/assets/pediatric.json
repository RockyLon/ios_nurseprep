        "Explanation": "Clinical pathways are interdisciplinary documents provided by a hospital to suggest ideal sequencing and timing of events and interventions for specific diseases to improve efficiency of care and enhance recovery. This pathway serves as a model outlining the typical hospital stay for individuals with specified conditions. Healthy People 2020 contains objectives set by the U.S. government to improve the health and reduce the incidence of death in the twenty-first century. Child mortality statistics can be compared with those from other decades for the evaluation of achievement toward health-care goals.

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The incorporation of the family’s cultural perspective into the care plan is most likely to result in the family’s ability to accept medical care and comply with the regimen prescribed. Since culture develops from social learning, attempts to ignore or minimize cultural consideration will result in mistrust, suspicion, or offenses that can have negative effects upon the health of children by reducing the resources available to promote health and prevent illness. Complementary therapy may be used later if other primary therapies prove to be ineffective.",

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "In the role of an advocate, a nurse will advance the interests of another; by suggesting the family investigate its SCHIP eligibility, the nurse is directing their action toward the child’s best interest.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Informed consent is legal preauthorization for an invasive procedure. It is the physician’s legal responsibility to obtain this, because it consists of an explanation about the medical condition, a detailed description of treatment plans, the expected benefits and risks related to the proposed treatment plan, alternative treatment options, the client’s questions, and the guardian’s right to refuse treatment.",

        "Choice 2": "2. A cohabitating unmarried boyfriend of the child’s mother",
        "Choice 3": "3. A grandparent who lives in the home with the child",
        "Choice 4": "4. A babysitter with written proxy consent",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "A parent may grant proxy consent in writing to another adult so that children are not denied necessary health care. In the case of divorced parents, the parent with custody may be the only parent allowed by some states to give informed consent. Residence in the same household with a child does not authorize an adult to sign consent for treatment.",

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Assent requires the ability to generally understand what procedure and treatments are planned, to understand what participation is required, and to make a statement of agreement or disagreement with the plan. Usually, in Piaget’s stage of formal operations, 11- to 13-year-olds should be able to problem solve using abstract concepts and are able to give valid assent when parents sign the informed consent. An emancipated minor is a self-supporting adolescent who is not subject to the control of a parent or guardian. A mature minor is a 14- or 15-year-old whom the state law designates as being able to understand medical risks and who is thus permitted to give informed consent for treatment.",

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Meeting the scope and standards of practice for pediatric nursing would cover the pediatric nurse against an accusation of malpractice or negligence because the standards are rigorous and cover all bases of excellent nursing practice. Following the physician’s written orders or acting on the advice of the nurse manager are not enough to defend the nurse from accusations because the orders and/or advice may be wrong or unethical. Being a clinical nurse specialist or nurse practitioner does not defend the nurse against these accusations if he or she does not follow the Society of Pediatric Nurses standards of practice.",

        "Explanation": "A breach of privacy would have been committed in this situation, because it violates the right to privacy of this family. The right to privacy is the right of a person to keep his or her person and property free from public scrutiny, including other family members. Negligence and malpractice are punishable legal offenses and are more serious. A breach of ethics would not apply to this situation.",

        "Answer": "2, 3, 4",
        "Explanation": "Interventions that will enhance family-centered care for this client and family include asking the adolescent to be an active member of care by making food choices, allowing the family to pray each day with the adolescent, and encouraging the adolescent’s friends to visit during visiting hours. These interventions each promote the concepts of family-centered care.

        "Question": "The parents of an 8-year-old state that their son seems very interested in trying new activities. When the parents ask for suggested activities for this age child, the nurse recommends scouts as an activity that will foster growth and development. In which stage of Erikson’s “psychosocial stages of development” is this child?",
        "Choice 1": "1. Trust versus mistrust",
        "Choice 2": "2. Initiative versus guilt",
        "Choice 3": "3. Industry versus inferiority",
        "Choice 4": "4. Identity versus role confusion",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Trust versus mistrust (birth to 1 year)—The task of the first year of life is to establish trust in the people providing care. Trust is fostered by provision of food, clean clothing, touch, and comfort. If basic needs are not met, the infant will eventually learn to mistrust others. Initiative versus guilt (3 to 6 years)—The young child initiates new activities and considers new ideas. This interest in exploring the world creates a child who is involved and busy. Constant criticism, on the other hand, leads to feelings of guilt and a lack of purpose. Identity versus role confusion (12 to 18 years)—In adolescence, as the body matures and thought processes become more complex, a new sense of identity or self is established. The self, family, peer group, and community are all examined and redefined. The adolescent who is unable to establish a meaningful definition of self will experience confusion in one or more roles of life. Industry versus inferiority (6 to 12 years)—The middle years of childhood are characterized by development of new interests and by involvement in activities. The child takes pride in accomplishments in sports, school, home, and community. If the child cannot accomplish what is expected, however, the result will be a sense of inferiority.",

        "Explanation": "Parallel play describes when two or more children play together, each engaging in their own activities. Cooperative play happens when children demonstrate the ability to cooperate with others and play a part in order to contribute to a unified whole. Associative play is characterized by children interacting in groups and participating in similar activities. In solitary play, a child plays alone.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Attachment is a strong emotional bond between a parent and child that forms the foundation for the fulfillment of the basic need of trust in the infant.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The most appropriate response would be to acknowledge the child’s feelings and give her something to look forward to (picking out a sticker). Waiting for the mother to come back would be inappropriate because toddlers do not have an understanding of time. Giving elaborate descriptions and using colorful language are inappropriate. The instructions should not end with a “are you ready” statement because the toddler will say no. You also don’t want to frighten and/or confuse the child by using statements such as use of a magic sword.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Asking the parents to talk about their concerns is an open-ended question and one which is more likely to establish rapport and an understanding of the parent’s perceptions. Giving the family a list of items to answer at once may be confusing to the parents. Giving an introduction before asking the parents for information is likely to establish rapport, but giving an explanation of why the information would be needed would be even more effective at establishing rapport and also for getting more accurate, pertinent information. Simply asking the parents to fill out forms is very impersonal, and more information is likely to be obtained and clarified if the nurse is directing the interview.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Repeating the name of an object after 5–10 minutes is assessing recent memory. Asking the child to repeat his address is assessing remote memory. Listening to speech articulation and pointing to body parts both assess communication skills.",

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "4, 2, 3, 1",
        "Explanation": "In examining a toddler, it is usually best to go from least invasive to most invasive examination in order to build her trust and cooperation. Developmental assessment involves visual inspection and activities that the toddler may view as games and will likely cooperate with. Auscultation is usually less threatening to the toddler than palpation, especially if the nurse were to use the stethoscope on a parent or a toy. The most uncomfortable, invasive exam for the toddler is most likely to be the examination of the eyes, ears, and throat, so that should be performed last.",

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "This infant’s sclerae are showing signs of jaundice, which most likely is secondary to a failure or malfunction of the liver in the gastrointestinal system. Cyanosis of the skin and mucous membranes is generally a sign of problems with the cardiac and/or respiratory system. Tenting of the skin and dry mucous membranes could be a sign of dehydration, and edema could be a sign of fluid overload.

        "Choice 4": "4. Range of motion and ankle mobility",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Dependent, pitting edema, especially in the lower extremities, can be a symptom of both kidney and cardiac disorders. Decreases in urine output can also indicate compromise in both the renal and cardiac systems. Changes in level of consciousness, if present, would more than likely be a later effect in this situation.

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 3, 4",
        "Explanation": "Wheezing is caused by air passing through mucus or fluids in a narrowed lower airway, which is a condition present in asthma exacerbations. The air trapping in the lungs that occurs in asthma causes a decrease in the sensation of vibrations felt, not an increase in tactile fremitus, which is indicative of pneumonia. Bronchophony is an increase in the intensity and clarity of transmitted sounds. This is also indicative of pneumonia but not asthma, which causes a decrease in vocal resonance.",

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Normally, blood pressures in the lower extremities are the same as or higher than upper-extremity blood pressures. But in coarctation of the aorta, the narrowing of the aorta causes decreased blood flow to the lower extremities and thus lower-extremity blood-pressure readings are significantly lower than upper-extremity readings.

The nurse needs to gently inform the mother of this problem and to provide information to the mother on why it is a problem. Just making a statement on how warmly the child is dressed will not accomplish this goal or just telling the mother to only put one layer of clothing on the child does not provide a rationale for the mother to make a better decision the next time, so this statement also is not helpful to the mother.",

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The school nurse must evaluate why these three friends have all lost 15 pounds in one year. The best way to begin this assessment is to obtain a nutritional history for each client. Speaking with the parents would not be appropriate at this time.

The time between periods of grieving may be times of parental denial, which allows the family to function.

A child with cerebral palsy does not have the gross motor skills to qualify for the Olympics; thus, this is unrealistic.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Four to six months is the optimal age to begin supplemental feedings because earlier feeding of nonformula foods is not needed by the infant and does not promote sleep. Earlier feeding of nonformula foods, regardless of the infant’s weight, is more likely to cause the development of food allergies.

Carrots, beets, and spinach contain nitrates and should not be given before the age of 4 months. Squash, peas, and tomatoes are acceptable to try after an infant is 4 to 6 months old but should be given one at a time and three to five days after starting a new food.

        "Explanation": "Toddlers require a maximum of about one liter of milk per day. This toddler is consuming most of his or her calories from the milk and thus is not hungry. The high fat content of the milk and the high sugar content of the fruit juice are also contributing to the child’s higher weight-to-height percentile. Decreasing the amount and fat content of the milk and decreasing the intake of fruit juice will decrease calories and thus make the child hungry for other foods.

It is not unusual for toddlers to have food jags during which they only want one or two food items for that day. So it is more helpful to look at what their intake has been over a week instead of a day. Two to three cups of milk per day are sufficient for a toddler, and more than that can decrease the child’s desire for other foods and lead to dietary deficiencies. The correct general guideline for food quantity is one tablespoon of each food per year of age.

General anesthesia is not necessary for bone-marrow aspiration. Narcotics alone will not provide appropriate sedation to keep the child from remembering the procedure.

        "Question": "A mother refuses to have her child be immunized with measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine because she believes that letting her infant get these diseases will help him fight off other diseases later in life. Which response by the nurse is most appropriate?",
        "Choice 1": "1. Honor her request because she is the parent.",
        "Choice 2": "2. Explain that antibodies can fight many diseases.",
        "Choice 3": "3. Tell her that not immunizing her infant may protect pregnant women.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Explaining that if her child contracts measles, mumps, or rubella, he could have very serious and permanent complications from these diseases is correct because measles, mumps, and rubella all have potentially serious sequelae, such as encephalitis, brain damage, and deafness. Honoring her request is not correct because the nurse has a professional duty to explain that the mother’s belief about immunizations is erroneous and may result in harm to her infant. Explaining that antibodies can fight many diseases is not correct because the body makes antibodies that are specific to antigens of each disease. Antibodies for one disease cannot fight another disease. Telling her that not immunizing her infant may protect pregnant women is not correct because immunizing the infant with MMR vaccine will help protect pregnant women from contracting rubella by decreasing the transmission. If a pregnant woman contracts rubella, her fetus can be severely damaged with congenital rubella syndrome.",

Then a lacy maculopapular erythematous rash spreads symmetrically from the trunk to the extremities, sparing the soles and palms. Varicella (chicken pox) and rubella (German measles) are unlikely if the child has had all recommended immunizations. The rash of varicella progresses from papules to vesicles to pustules. The rash of rubella is a pink maculopapular rash that begins on the face and progresses downward to the trunk and extremities.

        "Choice 1": "1. A minor illness with a low-grade fever is a contraindication to receiving an immunization according to Healthy People 2020.",

        "Explanation": "Infants under 3 months of age have limited ability to develop antibodies to fight infection, and a fever as high as 40.1 degrees C indicates a serious infection. Difficulty to awaken and a pulsing fontanel, purple spots on the skin and lethargy, a stiff neck and irritability for three days in infants and children of any age may indicate meningitis. A mild fever of 38.0 degrees C (100.4 degrees F) in the 4-month-old who received a DTaP immunization yesterday is incorrect because the mild fever is expected as the body develops antibodies in response to antigens in the immunization.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Young children need to be physically active at this age. “Research has shown that children with a television in their bedroom spend significantly less time playing outside than other children, and physical inactivity in children has been linked to many chronic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes” is the best response because it gives the parents an evidence-based rationale for not placing a television in the child’s room. “Don’t buy a television for your child’s room; he is much too young for that” does not give parents a rationale and may seem opinionated to them. While there may be some truth in the comment “Research has shown that watching educational television shows improves a child’s performance in school,” this statement may encourage increased television watching by the child, and the child’s developmental need for physical activity is greater than the benefit that he may obtain by watching educational programs. “It is okay for children to have a television in their room as long as you limit the amount of time they watch it to less than two hours per day” is correct in that limiting television viewing to less than two hours per day is appropriate, but the probability of this occurring with a television in the child’s room is low, and the child will most likely be watching much more than two hours per day.",

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "While all of the strategies are good, the most effective tip would be to have a local high school basketball star come to talk to the students about the importance of not smoking, because students at this age are more likely to listen to and attempt to emulate someone of their own peer group whom they respect and look up to. Information from adults, posters, and signed contracts are not as likely to influence children of this age more than the pressure of their peers.",

        "Explanation": "Over 4,000 youth from 10 to 19 years old die from firearm homicides annually, and approximately 1500 additional youth die from firearm suicide. Firearm homicide is the second leading cause of injury death for youth, and firearm suicide is the fifth leading cause of injury death for youth (CDC, 2011c). The safety measures of using a gun lock, keeping the gun and ammunition separate, and putting the guns in a locked cabinet will at least make the guns less accessible. Telling a child that a gun is “dangerous” and not to be touched will probably make it more fascinating. Even with knowledge of the proper use of a firearm, a 10-year-old child’s judgment may not be mature enough to prevent misuse of it.",

Preoperatively, there is a risk of aspiration of gastric secretions from the stomach into the trachea because of the fistula that connects the lower segment of the esophagus to the trachea. Pain is not usually experienced preoperatively with this condition. The infant is always kept NPO (nothing by mouth) preoperatively, so ineffective feeding pattern would not apply. Tissue perfusion is not a problem with this condition.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Skin irritation around the stoma should be assessed; it may indicate leakage. Physical or chemical skin irritation may occur if the appliance is changed too frequently or with each wet diaper. Adhesive enhancers should be avoided on the skin of newborns. Their skin layers are thin, and removal of the appliance can strip off the skin. Also, adhesive contains latex, and its constant use is not advised due to risk of latex allergy development.

        "Explanation": "A diaphragmatic hernia (protrusion of abdominal contents into the chest cavity through a defect in the diaphragm) is a life-threatening condition. Intubation is required immediately so the newborn’s respiratory status can be stabilized. A bag and mask will not be adequate to ventilate a newborn with this condition.

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Omeprazole is the proton pump inhibitor that blocks the action of acid-producing cells and is used to treat gastroesophageal reflux. Ranitidine causes the stomach to produce less acid and may be used to treat gastroesophageal reflux, but it is a histamine-2 receptor blocker.

        "Question": "A nurse is conducting a daily weight on a pediatric client diagnosed with diabetes insipidus and notes the child has lost two pounds in 24 hours. Which action by the nurse is the most appropriate?",
        "Choice 1": "1. Continue to monitor the child.",
        "Choice 2": "2. Notify the healthcare provider regarding the weight loss.",
        "Choice 3": "3. Chart the weight and report the loss to the next shift.",
        "Choice 4": "4. Do nothing more than chart the weight, as this would be a normal finding.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "With diabetes insipidus, the child may have severe fluid-volume deficit. A weight loss of two pounds indicates a loss of one liter of fluid, so the healthcare provider should be notified and fluids replaced either orally or intravenously. This is a significant loss in a 24-hour period, so continuing to monitor, charting the weight and reporting to the next shift, and doing nothing would prolong treatment.",

        "Question": "The nurse is caring for a pediatric client diagnosed with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) disorder. Which interventions should the nurse implement for this child?",
        "Choice 1": "1. Encouragement of fluids",
        "Choice 2": "2. Strict intake and output",
        "Choice 3": "3. Administration of ordered diuretics",
        "Choice 4": "4. Specific gravity of urine",
        "Choice 5": "5. Weight only on admission but not daily",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "2, 3, 4",
        "Explanation": "SIADH results from an excessive amount of serum antidiuretic hormone, causing water intoxication and hyponatremia. Intake and output should be monitored strictly. Diuretics such as furosemide (Lasix) are administered to eliminate excess body fluid, and urine specific gravity is monitored. Fluids are restricted to prevent further hemodilution. Daily weights should be obtained to monitor fluid balance.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Graves disease occurs when thyroid hormone levels are increased, resulting in excessive levels of circulating thyroid hormones. Clinical manifestations include tachycardia, fatigue, and heat intolerance. Weight gain, hirsutism, and muscle weakness are signs of Cushing syndrome. Dehydration, metabolic acidosis, and hypertension are signs of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Hyperglycemia, ketonuria, and glucosuria are signs of diabetes.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Adrenal insufficiency can cause fluid deficit. The goal of care is to maintain fluid and electrolyte balance while normal levels of corticosteroids and mineral corticoids are established. Therefore, Acute Pain and Imbalanced Nutrition: More than Body Requirements are not priority nursing diagnoses. A symptom of adrenal insufficiency is hypotension, not hypertension.",

At school the client had two more pieces of birthday cake and some ice cream at a class birthday party. What is the likely reason for this client’s unconscious state?",
        "Choice 1": "1. Metabolic alkalosis",
        "Choice 2": "2. Metabolic ketoacidosis",
        "Choice 3": "3. Insulin shock",
        "Choice 4": "4. Insulin reaction",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Metabolic acidosis or ketoacidosis could have occurred because of the excessive intake of sugar with no additional insulin. The body burns fat and protein stores for energy when no insulin is available to metabolize glucose. Altered consciousness occurs as symptoms progress. Metabolic alkalosis, insulin shock, or insulin reaction would not be happening in this case.",

        "Choice 3": "3. Increased need for insulin",
        "Choice 4": "4. Decreased risk of insulin reaction",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Increased physical activity requires adequate caloric intake to prevent hypoglycemia, so food intake should be increased. Increased activity would not require decreased food intake, and it would not result in a decreased risk of insulin reaction. Exercise causes the insulin to be used more efficiently, so increased insulin would not be needed.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The lack of growth and sexual development associated with Turner syndrome presents problems with psychosocial development. Self-image, self-consciousness, and self-esteem are affected by the girl’s perception of her body and how she differs from peers. The nurse should encourage more expression of the girl’s feelings. Responding that the feelings will pass, that she’ll start to grow, or that she is upset about the disease would not be therapeutic.",

Absorption of medications administered intramuscularly in neonates and infants is affected by muscle mass and perfusion of the area. Neonates and infants have less muscle mass than older children or adults (25% of body weight compared to 40% of body weight in adults). The smaller muscle size results in less volume capacity and less absorptive surface. There is decreased muscle tone and lower muscle oxygenation and vasomotor instability with diminished and unpredictable peripheral blood flow. Thus, absorption of drugs administered intramuscularly in neonates and infants is best described as slower and unreliable."

        "Question": "In working with the breastfeeding mother of an infant with a cleft lip or cleft palate, the nurse will teach the mother to do which of the following before having the infant latch on?",
        "Choice 1": "Place a warm washcloth on the breast.",
        "Choice 2": "Pump part of the milk from the breast.",
        "Choice 3": "Place ice packs on the breast.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Feedback\r\nA\r\nCorrect. The infant usually feeds best then the breast is full. Therefore, teach the mother to place a warm washcloth on the breast to encourage the milk let-down prior to having the infant latch on.\r\nB\r\nIncorrect. Ice packs will decrease blood flow to the breast and be counterproductive to effective breastfeeding.\r\nC\r\nIncorrect. Pumping part of the milk from the breast before the baby latches on would be inappropriate. In preparation for latch on it may be helpful for the mother to manually express a few drops of milk and spread it over the nipple. This may entice the baby to open the mouth as the milk is tasted.\r\nD\r\nIncorrect. Giving a little water from a bottle first is not advisable because the baby may become confused going from bottle to breast then breastfeeding is first initiated. Many practitioners recommend that bottles be avoided until breastfeeding is well established, usually after 3 to 4 weeks."

The ESSR method involves enlarge, stimulate, swallow, and rest. This method uses standard nipples and bottles and is inexpensive and convenient. It includes enlarging the nipple hole by making a cross-cut so the infant will receive formula in the back of the throat for swallowing, thus bypassing the sucking problem. The next step refers to stimulating the sucking reflex by rubbing the nipple on the lower lip. The infant swallows the formula normally. The last step is a rest."

The nurse informs the mother that tonsillectomies are usually performed when the child is over 3 years old. The mother wants to know why children younger than 3 have to wait for a tonsillectomy. Which of the following is the nurse’s best answer?",
        "Choice 1": "“Surgery is too difficult on a younger child, because their mouths are so small, making it difficult to get to the tonsils.”",
        "Choice 2": "“It is too scary for younger children, and they don’t understand what is happening.”",

However, that is not the major reason.\r\nB\r\nCorrect. The nurse advises a new mother to talk to her baby while the baby is awake because babies learn receptive language first and have an understanding of language before they can speak. Language development involves two inter-related processes: receptive language (understanding what others say to you) and expressive language (the ability to speak verbally in a way that others can understand). Children learn receptive language first; therefore, they can understand more than they can verbalize.\r\nC\r\nIncorrect. A new mother may talk to her baby while the baby is awake to soothe and calm the infant, but that is not the major rationale.\r\nD\r\nIncorrect. A baby does not need to learn baby talk before speaking words. In fact, caregivers should use correct language then talking to their infant. They should not use “baby talk”."

Children with this type of hearing loss have damage to the tiny hairs lining the cochlea or to nerve cells that transmit auditory stimuli to the brain. Hearing aids provide little benefit because even amplified sounds cannot be processed as a result of damage to the inner ear.\r\nB\r\nCorrect. A sensorineural hearing loss results from damage to the inner ear structures or the auditory nerve. This type of hearing loss results in distortion of sound and problems in discrimination. Although the child hears some of everything, the sounds are distorted, severely affecting discrimination and comprehension. This hearing loss has benefited in some cases by the relatively new technique of a cochlear implant.\r\nC\r\nIncorrect. A sensorineural hearing loss will not have been helped by hearing aids, but other techniques such as cochlear implantation have helped.\r\nD\r\nIncorrect.

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Feedback\r\nA\r\nIncorrect. Elevation of the injured part and application of ice will reduce swelling. Rest or staying off the injury for several hours to several days is also important; however, elevation and ice are more critical.\r\nB\r\nCorrect. During the first 24 to 48 hours following a soft tissue injury of the ankle a parent should elevate the leg and use an ice pack to the ankle, alternating 30 minutes on and 15 off.\r\nC\r\nIncorrect. The nurse will not advise the parent to apply alternating heat and cold with 15 minutes of heat and 15 minutes of cold.\r\nD\r\nIncorrect. If an Ace bandage or wrap is used, it should not be wrapped too tightly as this may impair neurovascular status. Ice and elevation take priority over wrapping the ankle."

        "Question": "The nurse is working with a child who is hospitalized and in traction. The parents of this child share with the nurse that the child is very angry with them at times. They share that they are hurt and frustrated by this anger because they are staying with the child and doing all they can to make the experience less traumatic.

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Feedback\r\nA\r\nIncorrect. This response encourages the parents to further express their feelings but does not explain the rationale for the child’s behavior.\r\nB\r\nIncorrect. Immobility deprives the child of a natural outlet for feelings. This child’s behavior is a normal response to being immobilized and does not require intervention of a psychologist.\r\nC\r\nCorrect. Children who are immobilized may exhibit a variety of psychological responses. The child may become angry, uncooperative, or engage in aggressive behaviors (especially toward the caregivers). It is important for the nurse to reassure caregivers that they should not take it personally. The child is displacing anger on them because they are safe targets, safer than the physicians and nurses.\r\nD\r\nIncorrect. This is not a helpful response because the parents are asking the nurse for an explanation of the child’s anger."

        "Explanation": "These parents are implementing the guidelines to reduce the risk of SIDS. Infants should sleep on their backs and then be placed on their abdomens when awake to enhance development of milestones such as head control. The face-down position while awake and on the back for sleep are acceptable because they reduce risk of SIDS and allow achievement of developmental milestones. These position changes encourage gross motor, not fine motor, development."

        "Explanation": "Infants are usually in the secondary circular reaction stage from ages 4 to 8 months. This stage is characterized by a continuation of the primary circular reaction for the response that results. Shaking is performed to hear the noise of the rattle, not just for shaking. The use of reflexes is primarily during the first month of life. Primary circular reaction stage marks the replacement of reflexes with voluntary acts. The infant is in this stage from ages 1 to 4 months. The fourth sensorimotor stage is coordination of secondary schemata. This is a transitional stage in which increasing motor skills enable greater exploration of the environment."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "During the first 6 months of life, infants believe that objects exist only as long as they can see them. When infants search for an object that is out of sight, this signals the attainment of object permanence, whereby an infant knows an object exists even when it is not visible. Between ages 8 and 12 weeks, infants begin to respond differentially to the mother. They cry, smile, vocalize, and show distinct preference for the mother. This preference is one of the stages that influences the attachment process but is too early for object permanence. Recognizing familiar objects is an important transition for the infant, but it does not signal object permanence. The ability to understand cause and effect is part of secondary schemata development."

        "Explanation": "Between ages 6 and 8 months, fear of strangers and stranger anxiety become prominent and are related to the infant’s ability to discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar people. At 2 months, infants are just beginning to respond differentially to the mother. At age 4 months, the infant is beginning the process of separation-individuation when the infant begins to recognize self and mother as separate beings.

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Physiologically and developmentally, the 4- to 6-month-old infant is in a transition period. The extrusion reflex has disappeared, and swallowing is a more coordinated process. In addition, the gastrointestinal tract has matured sufficiently to handle more complex nutrients and is less sensitive to potentially allergenic food. Infants of this age will try to help during feeding; 2 to 3 months is too young. The extrusion reflex is strong, and the child will push food out with the tongue. No research indicates that the addition of solid food to a bottle has any benefit. Infant birth weight doubles at 1 year. Solid foods can be started earlier. Tooth eruption can facilitate biting and chewing; most infant foods do not require this ability."

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "One food item is introduced at intervals of 4 to 7 days to allow the identification of food allergies. Solid foods can be introduced earlier. The extrusion reflex usually disappears by age 6 months. Mixing solid foods in a bottle has no effect on the transition to solid food. Iron-fortified cereal should be the first solid food introduced into the infant’s diet."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Co-sleeping, or sharing the family bed, in which the parents allow the children to sleep with them, is a common and accepted practice in many cultures. Parents should evaluate the options available and avoid conditions that place the infant at risk. Population-based studies are currently under way; no evidence at this time supports or condemns the practice for safety reasons. Co-sleeping is a cultural practice. One year is the age at which children are just beginning to individuate. Increased daytime activity may help decrease sleep problems in general, but co-sleeping is a culturally determined phenomenon."

        "Explanation": "Several topical anesthetic agents can be used to minimize the discomfort associated with immunization injections. These include EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetic) and vapor coolant sprays. Pain associated with many procedures can be prevented and minimized by using the principles of atraumatic care. With preparation, the injection site can be properly anesthetized to decrease the amount of pain felt by the infant. Infants have the neural pathways to feel pain. Numerous research studies have indicated that infants perceive and react to pain in the same manner as do children and adults.

        "Explanation": "Hot dogs are of a consistency, diameter, and round shape that may cause complete obstruction of the child’s airway. If given to young children, the hot dog should be cut into small irregular pieces rather than served whole or in slices. The child’s digestive system is mature enough to digest hot dogs.

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": ", , , , , , , ",
        "Explanation": "Grasping occurs during the first 2 to 3 months as a reflex and gradually becomes voluntary. By 5 months, infants are able to voluntarily grasp objects. Gradually, the palmar grasp (using the whole hand) is replaced by a pincer grasp (using the thumb and index finger). By 8 to 10 months of age, infants use a crude pincer grasp, and by 11 months, they have progressed to a neat pincer grasp. By 11 months, they put objects into containers and like to remove them. By age 1 year, infants try to build towers of two blocks but fail."

        "Explanation": "Marasmus is characterized by gradual wasting and atrophy of body tissues, especially of subcutaneous fat. The child appears to be very old, with loose and wrinkled skin, unlike the child with kwashiorkor, who appears more rounded from the edema. Fat metabolism is less impaired than in kwashiorkor; thus, deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins is usually minimal or absent. In general, the clinical manifestations of marasmus are similar to those seen in kwashiorkor with the following exceptions: With marasmus, there is no edema from hypoalbuminemia or sodium retention, which contributes to a severely emaciated appearance; no dermatoses caused by vitamin deficiencies; little or no depigmentation of hair or skin; moderately normal fat metabolism and lipid absorption; and a smaller head size and slower recovery after treatment."

        "Explanation": "Many foods interfere with iron absorption and should be avoided when the iron is consumed. These foods include phosphates found in milk, phytates found in cereals, and oxalates found in many vegetables. Multivitamins may contain iron; no contraindication exists to taking the two together.

Vitamin D is the most likely of all vitamins to cause toxic reactions in relatively small overdoses. The water-soluble vitamins, primarily niacin, B6, and C, can also cause toxicity but not at the low dose that occurs with vitamin D."

        "Explanation": "Treatment of CMA is elimination of cow’s milk–based formula and all other dairy products. For infants fed cow’s milk formula, this primarily involves changing the formula to a casein hydrolysate milk formula (Pregestimil, Nutramigen, or Alimentum). Goat’s milk (raw) is not an acceptable substitute because it cross-reacts with cow’s milk protein, is deficient in folic acid, has a high sodium and protein content, and is unsuitable as the only source of calories.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Colic is multifactorial, and no single treatment is effective for all infants. The parent is verbalizing concern and worry. The nurse should allow the parent to put these feelings into words. An empathic, gentle, and reassuring attitude, in addition to suggestions about remedies, will help alleviate the parent’s anxieties. The nurse should reassure the parent that he or she is not doing anything wrong. Colic is multifactorial. The infant with colic is experiencing spasmodic pain that is manifested by loud crying, in some cases up to 3 hours each day. Telling the parent that it will eventually go away does not help him or her through the current situation."

        "Explanation": "Changing the infant’s position frequently may be beneficial. The parent can walk holding the child face down and with the child’s chest across the parent’s arm. The parent’s hand can support the child’s abdomen, applying gentle pressure. Gently massaging the abdomen is effective in some children. Pacifiers can be used for meeting additional sucking needs.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The infant with failure to thrive should have a structured routine that is followed consistently. Disruptions in other activities of daily living can have a great impact on feeding behaviors. Bathing, sleeping, dressing, playing, and feeding are structured. The nurse should talk to the child by giving directions about eating. This will help the child maintain focus. Young children should be held while being fed, and older children can sit at a feeding table. The child should be fed in the same manner at each meal.

An explanation of how SIDS could have been predicted and prevented is inappropriate. SIDS cannot be prevented or predicted. Discussions about the cause will only increase parental guilt.

Encourage eye contact and remain with the infant throughout the meal. Stimulation is not recommended; a quiet, unstimulating atmosphere should be maintained. Persistence during feeding may need to be implemented. Calm perseverance through 10 to 15 minutes of food refusal will eventually diminish negative behavior. Although forced feeding is avoided, “strictly encouraged” feeding is essential.

        "Choice 1": "Allow parents to say goodbye to their infant.",
        "Choice 2": "Once parents leave the hospital, no further follow-up is required.",
        "Choice 3": "Arrange for someone to take the parents home from the hospital.",
        "Choice 4": "Avoid requesting an autopsy of the deceased infant.",
        "Choice 5": "Conduct a debriefing session with the parents before they leave the hospital.",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 3, 5",
        "Explanation": "An important aspect of compassionate care for parents experiencing a SIDS incident is allowing them to say good-bye to their infant. These are the parents’ last moments with their infant, and they should be as quiet, meaningful, peaceful, and undisturbed as possible. Because the parents leave the hospital without their infant, it is helpful to accompany them to the car or arrange for someone else to take them home. A debriefing session may help health care workers who dealt with the family and deceased infant to cope with emotions that are often engendered when a SIDS victim is brought into the acute care facility. An autopsy may clear up possible misconceptions regarding the death. When the parents return home, a competent, qualified professional should visit them after the death as soon as possible."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Toddlers continue to have the short, straight internal ear canal of infants. The lymphoid tissue of the tonsils and adenoids continues to be relatively large. These two anatomic conditions combine to predispose the toddler to frequent infections. The abdominal respirations and lowered pulse and respiratory rate of toddlers do not affect their susceptibility to infection. The defense mechanisms are more efficient compared with those of infancy."

        "Explanation": "If the need for basic trust has been satisfied, then toddlers can give up dependence for control, independence, and autonomy. One of the tasks that the toddler is concerned with is the ability to delay gratification. Development of a conscience occurs during the preschool years. The recognition of sex differences occurs during the preschool years. The ability to get along with age-mates develops during the preschool and school-age years."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Toddlers use distinct behaviors in the quest for autonomy. They express their will with continued negativity and the use of the word “no.” Children at this age also have rapid mood swings. The nurse should reassure the parents that their child is engaged in expected behavior for an 18-month-old. Having a rapid mood swing is an expected behavior for a toddler."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The 17-month-old child is in the fifth stage of the sensorimotor phase, tertiary circular reactions. The child uses active experimentation to achieve previously unattainable goals. Trust is Erikson’s first stage. Preoperational is the stage of cognitive development usually present in older toddlers and preschoolers. Secondary circular reactions last from about ages 4 to 8 months."

        "Choice 1": "Searches for an object only if he or she sees it being hidden",
        "Choice 2": "Realizes that “out of sight” is not out of reach",
        "Choice 3": "Puts objects into a container but cannot take them out",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "At this age, the child is in the final sensorimotor stage. Children will now search for an object in several potential places, even though they saw only the original hiding place. Children have a more developed sense of objective permanence. They will search for objects even if they have not seen them hidden. When a child puts objects into a container but cannot take them out, this is indicative of tertiary circular reactions. An embryonic sense of time exists, although the children may behave appropriately to time-oriented phrases; their sense of timing is exaggerated."

        "Choice 1": "Her cognitive development is delayed.",
        "Choice 2": "This is typical behavior because toddlers are not very developed.",
        "Choice 3": "This is typical behavior because of the inability to transfer knowledge to new situations.",
        "Choice 4": "This is not typical behavior because toddlers should know better than to repeat an act that caused pain.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "During the tertiary circular reactions stage, children have only a rudimentary sense of the classification of objects. The appearance of an object denotes its function for these children. The slot of an outlet is for putting things into. Her cognitive development is appropriate for her age. Trying to put things into an outlet is typical behavior for a toddler. Only some awareness exists of a causal relation between events."

        "Choice 1": "This is typical behavior because toddlers are aggressive.",
        "Choice 2": "This is typical behavior because toddlers are egocentric.",
        "Choice 3": "Toddlers should know that sharing toys is expected of them.",
        "Choice 4": "Toddlers should have the cognitive ability to know right from wrong.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Play develops from the solitary play of infancy to the parallel play of toddlers. The toddler plays alongside other children, not with them. This typical behavior of the toddler is not intentionally aggressive. Shared play is not within their cognitive development. Toddlers do not conceptualize shared play. Because the toddler cannot view the situation from the perspective of the other child, it is okay to take the toy. Therefore, no right or wrong is associated with taking a toy."

        "Choice 4": "Delayed cognitive development",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Animism is the attribution of lifelike qualities to inanimate objects. By scolding the stairs, the toddler is attributing human characteristics to them. Ritualism is the need to maintain the sameness and reliability. It provides a sense of comfort to the toddler. Irreversibility is the inability to reverse or undo actions initiated physically.

        "Explanation": "During the second year of life, level of comprehension and understanding of speech increases and is far greater than the child’s vocabulary. This is also true for bilingual children, who are able to achieve this linguistic milestone in both languages. The 18-month-old child has a vocabulary of 10 or more words.

        "Explanation": "Voluntary control of the anal and urethral sphincters is achieved sometime after the child is walking. The child must be able to recognize the urge to let go and to hold on. The child must want to please parent by holding on rather than pleasing self by letting go. Bowel training precedes bladder training.

        "Explanation": "Building with blocks is a good parent-child interaction. The 18-month-old child is capable of building a tower of three or four blocks. The ability to build towers of blocks usually begins at age 15 months. With ongoing development, the child is able to build taller towers. The 18-month-old child imitates others around him or her."

Toddlers have their entire schedule and routines disrupted because of the new family member. The nurse should work with parents on ways to involve the toddler in the newborn’s care and to help focus attention on the toddler. The toddler does not hate the infant.

Tantrums are common in toddlers as the child becomes more independent and overwhelmed by increasingly complex tasks. The parents and caregivers need to have consistent and developmentally appropriate expectations. Punishment and explanations will not be beneficial.

The child should be weaned from a milk- or formula-based diet to a balanced diet that includes iron-rich sources of food."

        "Explanation": "For young children, the most effective cleaning of teeth is by the parents. Different positions can be used if the child’s back is to the adult. The adult should use one hand to stabilize the chin and the other to brush the child’s teeth. The child can participate in brushing, but for a thorough cleaning, adult intervention is necessary."

        "Choice 1": "Substitute raisins for candy.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Regular gum has high sugar content. When the child chews gum, the sugar is in prolonged contact with the teeth. Sugarless gum is less cariogenic than regular gum. Raisins, honey, and molasses are highly cariogenic and should be avoided. Sweets should be consumed with meals so that the teeth can be cleaned afterward. This decreases the amount of time that the sugar is in contact with the teeth."

Children 2 years old and older who have outgrown the rear-facing height or weight limit for their car safety seat should use a forward-facing car safety seat with a harness up to the maximum height or weight recommended by the manufacturer. One year is too young to switch to a forward-facing position."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Foreign-body aspiration is common during the second year of life. Although they chew well, this age child may have difficulty with large pieces of food, such as meat and whole hot dogs, and with hard foods, such as nuts or dried beans. Peanuts have many beneficial nutrients, but should be avoided because of the risk of aspiration in this age group. The sodium level may be a concern, but the risk of aspiration is more important. Many foods pass through the gastrointestinal tract incompletely undigested. This is not necessarily detrimental to the child."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The major reason for poisoning in the home is improper storage. Toddlers can climb, unlatch cabinets, and obtain access to high-security places. For medications, only a locked cabinet is safe. Toddlers can climb by using furniture. High places are not a deterrent to an exploring toddler. Toddlers are not able to generalize as dangerous all the different forms of medications that may be available in the home. It is not feasible to not keep medicines in the homes of small children. Many parents require medications for chronic illnesses. Parents must be taught safe storage for their home and when they visit other homes."

        "Explanation": "Flame burns from matches and lighters represent one of the most fatal types of burns in the toddler age group. High-temperature tap water, hot objects, and electrical outlets are all significant causes of burn injury. The child should be protected from these causes by reducing the temperature on the hot water in the home, keeping objects such as cigarettes and irons away from children, and placing protective guards over electric outlets when not in use."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Play objects for toddlers must still be chosen with an awareness of danger from small parts. Large, sturdy toys without sharp edges or removable parts are safest. Large plastic blocks are appropriate for a toddler in isolation. Small plastic toys such as Lego can cause choking or can be aspirated. Balloons can cause significant harm if swallowed or aspirated.

        "Choice 3": "Centration",
        "Choice 4": "Irreversibility",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The nurse is using the toddler’s inability to conserve. This is when the toddler is unable to understand the idea that a mass can be changed in size, shape, volume, or length without losing or adding to the original mass. Instead, toddlers judge what they see by the immediate perceptual clues given to them. A small glass means less amount of contrast. Magical thinking is believing that thoughts are all-powerful and can cause events. Centration is focusing on one aspect rather than considering all possible alternatives. Irreversibility is the inability to undo or reverse the actions initiated, such as being unable to stop doing an action when told."

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Parents need to be taught to always use the restraint even for short trips. Further teaching is needed if they make this statement. Parents have understood the teaching if they encourage the child to help attach buckles, straps, and shields but always double-check fastenings; do not start the car until everyone is properly restrained; and anchor the car safety seat securely to the car’s anchoring system and apply the harness snugly to the child."

Thinking God is like an imaginary friend is an example of concrete thinking in a preschooler’s spiritual development. Thinking that if the skin is broken, the child’s insides will come out is an example of concrete thinking in development of body image."

Their egocentrism makes them think they are directly responsible for events, making them feel guilty for things outside their control. Children of this age show stress by regressing developmentally or acting out. Maladaptation is unlikely.

        "Explanation": "Three-year-olds become aware of anatomic differences and are concerned about how the other “works.” Such exploration should not be condoned or condemned. Children should not be punished for this normal exploration. Encouraging the children to ask questions of the parents and redirecting their activity are more appropriate than giving permission. Exploration is age-appropriate and not dangerous behavior."

        "Explanation": "Television is also a significant source for modeling at this impressionable age. Research indicates there is a direct correlation between media exposure, both violent and educational media, and preschoolers exhibiting physical and relational aggression (Ostrov, Gentile, and Crick, 2006). Therefore, parents should be encouraged to supervise television viewing. The behavior should not be ignored because it can escalate to hyperaggression. The child should not be punished because it may reinforce the behavior if the child is seeking attention. For example, children who are ignored by a parent until they hit a sibling or the parent learn that this act garners attention. The behavior should not be accepted from a male child; this is using a “double standard” and aggression should not be equated with masculinity."

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Milk and dairy products are excellent sources of calcium and vitamin D (fortified). Low-fat milk may be substituted, so the quantity of milk may remain the same while limiting fat intake overall. Parents should be educated regarding non-nutritious fruit drinks, which usually contain less than 10% fruit juice yet are often advertised as healthy and nutritious; sugar content is dramatically increased and often precludes an adequate intake of milk by the child. In young children, intake of carbonated beverages that are acidic or that contain high amounts of sugar is also known to contribute to dental caries. Low fat milk should be substituted for whole milk if the child is slightly overweight."

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Because calcium disodium edetate (EDTA) and lead are toxic to the kidneys, a nurse should keep strict records of intake and output to monitor renal functioning. Adequate hydration is essential during therapy because the chelates are excreted via the kidneys.

        "Explanation": "Erythema infectiosum rash appears in three stages: erythema on face, chiefly on cheeks (“slapped face” appearance); disappears by 1-4 days. Chicken pox rash begins as macule, rapidly progresses to papule and then vesicle (surrounded by erythematous base; becomes umbilicated and cloudy; breaks easily and forms crusts); all three stages (papule, vesicle, crust) present in varying degrees at one time. Roseola rash is discrete rose-pink macules or maculopapules appearing first on trunk and then spreading to neck, face, and extremities; nonpruritic; fades on pressure; lasts 1-2 days. Rubeola rash—appears 3-4 days after onset of prodromal stage; begins as erythematous maculopapular eruption on face and gradually spreads downward; more severe in earlier sites (appears confluent) and less intense in later sites (appears discrete); after 3-4 days, assumes brownish appearance, and fine desquamation occurs over area of extensive involvement."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 2, 5",
        "Explanation": "Methods to reduce lead levels in homes include: planting bushes around the outside of the house, if soil is contaminated with lead, so children cannot play there; ensuring that children eat regular meals because more lead is absorbed on an empty stomach; and ensuring that children’s diets contain sufficient iron and calcium. Cold water should only be used for drinking, cooking, and reconstituting powder infant formula. Hot water dissolves lead more quickly than cold water and thus contains higher levels of lead. Do not use pottery or ceramic ware that was inadequately fired or is meant for decorative use for food storage or service."

Young children do not believe that standards of behavior come from within themselves, but that rules are established and set down by others.

        "Explanation": "Peer-group identification is an important factor in gaining independence from parents. Children learn how to relate to people in positions of leadership and authority and how to explore ideas and the physical environment. Becoming defiant in a peer-group relationship may lead to bullying. Peer-group identification helps in gaining independence rather than remaining dependent. One-on-one opposite sex relationships do not occur until adolescence. School-age children form peer groups of the same sex."

The nurse should review this with both the father and the child and develop a plan to maintain physical exercise and a balanced diet. It is false reassurance to tell the father that his son is not fat. His weight is high for his height. The child needs to maintain his physical activity.

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "One cognitive task of school-age children is mastering the concept of conservation. At an early age (5 to 7 years), children grasp the concept of reversibility of numbers as a basis for simple mathematics problems (e.g., 2 + 4 = 6 and 6 – 4 = 2). They learn that simply altering their arrangement in space does not change certain properties of the environment, and they are able to resist perceptual cues that suggest alterations in the physical state of an object. Animism, magical thinking, and believing that thoughts are all powerful are thought processes seen in preschool children."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "2, 3, 4",
        "Explanation": "Team play helps stimulate cognitive growth because children are called on to learn many complex rules, make judgments about those rules, plan strategies, and assess the strengths and weaknesses of members of their own team and members of the opposing team. Team play can also contribute to children’s social, intellectual, and skill growth. Children work hard to develop the skills needed to become team members, to improve their contribution to the group, and to anticipate the consequences of their behavior for the group. Team play teaches children to modify or exchange personal goals for goals of the group; it also teaches them that division of labor is an effective strategy for attaining a goal."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The apocrine sweat glands, nonfunctional in children, reach secretory capacity during puberty. They secrete a thick substance as a result of emotional stimulation that, when acted on by surface bacteria, becomes highly odoriferous. They are limited in distribution and grow in conjunction with hair follicles, in the axilla, genital, anal, and other areas. Eccrine sweat glands are present almost everywhere on the skin and become fully functional and respond to emotional and thermal stimulation. Sebaceous glands become extremely active at this time, especially those on the genitalia and the “flush” areas of the body such as face, neck, shoulders, upper back, and chest. This increased activity is important in the development of acne. New deposits of fatty tissue is not the etiology of apocrine sweat gland activity."

The nurse’s first priority is to give the young man permission to discuss his feelings about this topic, knowing that the nurse will maintain confidentiality, appreciate his feelings, and remain sensitive to his need to talk about the topic. In recent studies among self-identified gay, lesbian, and bisexual adolescents, many of the adolescents report changing self-labels one or more times during their adolescence.

        "Explanation": "Growth in length of the extremities and neck precedes growth in other areas, and, because these parts are the first to reach adult length, the hands and feet appear larger than normal during adolescence. Increases in hip and chest breadth take place in a few months followed several months later by an increase in shoulder width.

        "Explanation": "All adolescents should also be assessed for previous history of varicella infection or vaccination. Vaccination with the varicella vaccine is recommended for those with no previous history; for those with no previous infection or history, the varicella vaccine may be given in two doses 4 or more weeks apart to adolescents 13 years or older. The varicella immune globulin is given to immunosuppressed children exposed to chickenpox to boost immunity; it is only temporary. The varicella vaccination should be given to adolescents, no matter the age, who have not had chickenpox as a child."

        "Explanation": "Cigarettes are considered a gateway drug. Teenagers who smoke are 11.4 times more likely to use an illicit drug. Teenagers begin smoking for a variety of reasons, such as imitation of adult behavior, peer pressure, imitation of behaviors portrayed in movies and advertisements, and a desire to control weight. The absence of peer pressure alone will not stop smoking. Teenagers who do not smoke usually have parents and friends who do not smoke or who oppose smoking.

        "Explanation": "Drug therapy is increasingly being prescribed to treat enuresis. Three types of drugs are used: tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), antidiuretics, and antispasmodics. The selection depends on the interpretation of the cause. The drug used most frequently is the TCA imipramine (Tofranil), which exerts an anticholinergic action in the bladder to inhibit urination. Tofranil is in the antispasmodic category. Analgesics are not used to treat enuresis."

        "Explanation": "Most cases of constitutional growth delay are caused by simple constitutional delay of puberty, and the child can be assured that normal development will eventually take place. Listening to distressed adolescents and conveying interest and concern are important interventions for these children and adolescents.

        "Explanation": "The exact etiology of primary dysmenorrhea is debated. Overproduction of uterine prostaglandins has been implicated, as has overproduction of vasopressin. Dysmenorrhea is not known to be inherited. Excessive estrogen has not been implicated in the etiology. It has a physiologic cause. Women with dysmenorrhea have higher prostaglandin levels."

        "Choice 1": "Aspirin is the drug of choice for the treatment of dysmenorrhea.",
        "Choice 2": "Over-the-counter NSAIDs are rarely strong enough to provide adequate pain relief.",
        "Choice 3": "NSAIDs are effective because of their analgesic effect.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "First-line therapy for adolescents with dysmenorrhea is NSAIDs. This group of drugs blocks the formation of prostaglandins. NSAIDs, not aspirin, are the drugs of choice in dysmenorrhea. NSAIDs are potent anti-inflammatory agents that inhibit prostaglandin. Although NSAIDs have analgesic effects, the mechanism of action in dysmenorrhea is most likely the antiprostaglandin effect."

        "Explanation": "The male breast responds to hormonal changes. Some degree of bilateral or unilateral breast enlargement occurs frequently in boys during puberty. Although individuals with Klinefelter syndrome can have gynecomastia, it is not a common cause for male breast enlargement. Estrogen is not a therapy for gynecomastia.

With improved therapies, the mortality for teenage pregnancy is decreasing, but the morbidity is high. A pregnant teenager needs careful assessment by the nurse to determine the level of social support available to her and possibly her partner. Guidance from the adults in her life would be invaluable, but confidentiality should be maintained. Although it is important to explain the importance of not smoking and to discuss dietary needs for adequate fetal growth, because of her potential for having a high-risk pregnancy, she will need a comprehensive prenatal program to minimize maternal-fetal complications."

        "Explanation": "Weight loss may be triggered by a typical adolescent crisis such as the onset of menstruation or a traumatic interpersonal incident; situations of severe family stress, such as parental separation or divorce; or circumstances in which the young person lacks personal control, such as being teased, changing schools, or entering college. “Sexual abuse,” “school failure,” and “independence from family” are not part of the behavioral characteristics of anorexia nervosa."

        "Explanation": "Symptoms of anorexia nervosa include lower body temperature, severe weight loss, decreased blood pressure, dry skin, brittle nails, altered metabolic activity, and presence of lanugo hair. Amenorrhea, rather than dysmenorrhea, and cold intolerance are manifestations of anorexia nervosa. Bradycardia, rather than tachycardia, may be present."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Individuals with bulimia are of normal or more commonly slightly above normal weight. Those who also restrict their intake can become severely underweight. The adolescent has a lack of control over eating during the episode. Patients with bulimia commonly have self-deprecating thoughts and a depressed mood after binge-purge cycles; they are also aware that the eating pattern is abnormal but are unable to stop."

        "Explanation": "Some of the signs of bulimia include erosion of tooth enamel, increased dental caries from vomited gastric acid, throat complaints, fluid and electrolyte disturbances, and abdominal complaints from laxative abuse. Diarrhea is not a result of the vomiting. It may occur in patients with bulimia who also abuse laxatives. Amenorrhea and cold intolerance are characteristics of anorexia nervosa, which some bulimics have. These symptoms are related to the extreme low weight."

        "Choice 1": "Manifestations exhibited are so bizarre that the diagnosis is fairly easy.",
        "Choice 2": "Manifestations affect every aspect of the child’s life but are most obvious in the classroom.",
        "Choice 3": "Learning disabilities associated with ADHD eventually disappear when adulthood is reached.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "ADHD affects every aspect of the child’s life, but the disruption is most obvious in the classroom. The behaviors exhibited by the child with ADHD are not unusual aspects of behavior. The difference lies in the quality of motor activity and developmentally inappropriate inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity that the child displays. Some children experience decreased symptoms during late adolescence and adulthood, but a significant number carry their symptoms into adulthood. Any given child will not have every symptom of the condition. The manifestations may be numerous or few, mild or severe, and will vary with the child’s developmental level."

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Organic causes that may be related to enuresis should be ruled out before psychogenic factors are considered.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Children may be unaware of a prior sensation and unable to control the urge once it begins. They may be so accustomed to bowel accidents that they are unable to smell or feel it. Family counseling is directed toward reassurance that most problems resolve successfully, although relapses during periods of stress are possible. Sitting the child on the toilet is not recommended because it may intensify the parent-child conflict. Enemas may be needed for impactions, but long-term use prevents the child from assuming responsibility for defecation. Stimulant cathartics may cause cramping that can frighten child."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The primary goal is to return the child to school. Parents must be convinced gently, but firmly, that immediate return is essential and that it is their responsibility to insist on school attendance. The longer the child is permitted to stay out of school, the more difficult it will be for the child to reenter. Trying to find the cause of phobia will only delay the return to school and inhibit the child’s ability to cope. Professional counseling is recommended if the problem persists, but the child’s return to school should not wait for the counseling."

        "Explanation": "Physiologic characteristics of children with depression include change in appetite resulting in weight loss or gain, nonspecific complaints of not feeling well, alterations in sleeping pattern, insomnia or hypersomnia, and constipation. Children who are depressed have sad facial expressions with absence or diminished range of affective response. These children withdraw from previously enjoyed activities and engage in solitary play or work with a lack of interest in play. A lack of interest is seen in doing homework or achieving in school, resulting in lower grades in children who are depressed."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Physical dependence is an involuntary response to the pharmacologic characteristics of drugs such as opioids or alcohol. A person can be physically dependent on a narcotic/drug without being addicted; for example, patients who use opioids to control pain need increasing doses to achieve the same effect. Dependence is a physiologic response; it is not culturally determined or subject to voluntary control."

        "Explanation": "When the drug is questionable or unknown, every effort must be made to determine the type, amount of drug taken, the mode and time of administration, and factors relating to the onset of presenting symptoms. The actual content of most street drugs is highly questionable. Pharmacologic agents should be administered with caution, except for the narcotic antagonists in case of suspected opioid use. The function the drug plays in the adolescent’s life and the adolescent’s level of interest in rehabilitation are important considerations in the long-term management during the nonacute stage."

Gay and lesbian adolescents who live in families or communities that do not accept homosexuality are likely to suffer low self-esteem, self-loathing, depression, and hopelessness as a result of a lack of acceptance from their family or community. At-risk teenagers include those who are depressed, have poor problem-solving skills, or use drugs and alcohol.

For adolescent females, overdose and strangulation are the next most common means of completed suicide.

Questions such as, “Have you ever developed a plan to hurt yourself or kill yourself?” should be part of that assessment. Adolescents who express suicidal feelings and have a specific plan are at particular risk and require further assessment and constant monitoring.

Verbal instructions should be accompanied by visual references such as written instructions on the blackboard.

The parents are moving away from adjustment (and toward maladaptation) in the crisis of a child with chronic illness or disability."

        "Question": "Families progress through various stages of reactions when a child is diagnosed with a chronic illness or disability. After the shock phase, a period of adjustment usually follows. This is often characterized by which of the following responses?",
        "Choice 1": "Denial",
        "Choice 2": "Guilt and anger",
        "Choice 3": "Social reintegration",
        "Choice 4": "Acceptance of child’s limitations",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "For most families, the adjustment phase is accompanied by several responses. Guilt, self-accusation, bitterness, and anger are common reactions. The initial diagnosis of a chronic illness or disability often is met with intense emotion, characterized by shock and denial. Social reintegration and acceptance of the child’s limitations are the culmination of the adjustment process."

        "Choice 1": "Ask the parents if they feel guilty.",
        "Choice 2": "Discuss guilt only after the parents mention it.",
        "Choice 3": "Discuss the meaning of the parents’ religious and cultural background.",
        "Choice 4": "Observe for signs of overprotectiveness.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Guilt may be associated with cultural or religious beliefs. Some parents are convinced that they are being punished for some previous misdeed. Others may see the disorder as a sacrifice sent by God to test their religious beliefs. The nurse can help the parents explore their religious beliefs. The parents may not be able to identify the feelings of guilt. It would be appropriate for the nurse to explore their adjustment responses. Overprotectiveness is a parental response during the adjustment phase. The parents fear letting the child achieve any new skill and avoid all discipline."

        "Choice 3": "belief that procedures are a deserved punishment.",
        "Choice 4": "belief that procedures are an important part of care.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The nurse should be particularly alert to the child who passively accepts all painful procedures. This child may believe that such acts are inflicted as deserved punishment. The child who is hopeful is mobilized into goal-directed actions. This child would actively participate in care. Chronic sorrow is the feeling of sorrow and loss that recurs in waves over time. It is usually evident in the parents, not in the child. A child who believes that procedures are an important part of care would actively participate in care. Nursing interventions should be used to minimize the pain."

        "Choice 4": "“I will come back when you settle down.”",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Parental anger after the diagnosis of a child with a chronic disability is a common response. One of the most common targets for parental anger is members of the staff. The nurse should recognize the common response of anger to the diagnosis and allow the family to ventilate. “What is really wrong?”/“Yelling at me will not change things”/“I will come back when you settle down” will place the parents on the defensive and not facilitate communication."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Parental overprotection is manifested by the parents’ fear of letting the child achieve any new skill; they allow the child to avoid all discipline and cater to every desire to prevent frustration. Overprotective parents: do not set limits and or institute discipline; prefer to remain in the role of total caregiver; do not allow the child to perform self-care; and do not encourage the child to participate in social and educational activities."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Chronic sorrow is manifested by feelings of sorrow and loss that recur in waves over time. The sorrow is in response to the recognition of the child’s limitations. The family should be assessed in an ongoing manner to provide appropriate support as the needs of the family change. The sorrow is not preventable. The chronic sorrow occurs during the reintegration and acknowledgment stage."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Encouraging the toddler to be independent encourages a sense of autonomy. The child can be given choices about feeding, dressing, and diversional activities, which will provide a sense of control. Avoiding separation from family during hospitalizations, and helping parents learn special care needs of their child should be practiced as part of family-centered care. It does not necessarily foster autonomy. Exposing the child to pleasurable experiences, especially sensory ones, is a supportive intervention. It does not promote autonomy."

Toddlers are focused on establishing their autonomy. The illness will foster dependence. The school-age child will have limited opportunities for achievement and may not be able to understand limitations.

They have an understanding of their disorder that allows them to accept their limitations, assume responsibility for care, and assist in treatment and rehabilitation.

        "Explanation": "These are important data for the nurse to obtain. This question will provide information about the marital relationship (whether the parent speaks to the spouse), alternate support systems, and ability to communicate. By assessing these areas, the nurse can facilitate the identification and use of community resources as needed. It is an important part of assessment information to determine the parent’s support network. The nurse is obtaining information to help support the parent through the diagnosis.

The nurse should continue to provide the kind of information they desire. This is a particularly stressful time for the parents; the nurse can play a key role in providing necessary information. Parents should be provided with oral and written information. The nurse needs to work with the family to ensure understanding of the information. The parents require information at the time of diagnosis. Other questions will arise as they adjust to the information."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The school-age child who is ill may be forced into a period of dependency. To foster normalcy, the child should be given as much control as possible. It is unrealistic to expect one individual to make the child feel normal. The child has a chronic illness. It would be unacceptable to convince the child that nothing is wrong. The family rules should be similar for each of the children in a family. Resentment and hostility can arise if different standards are applied to each child."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The presence of a child with special needs in a family will change the family dynamic. Siblings may be asked to take on additional responsibilities to help the parents to care for the child. The parents should show gratitude, such as an increase in allowance, special privileges, and verbal praise. Embarrassment may be associated with having a sibling with a chronic illness or disability. Parents must be able to respond in an appropriate manner without punishing the sibling. The parents may need assistance with the care of the child. Most siblings are positive about the extra responsibilities. The siblings need to be informed about the child’s condition before a nonfamily member does so. The parents do not want the siblings to fantasize about what is wrong with the child."

        "Explanation": "Attendance at school is an important part of normalization for Kelly. The school nurse should prepare teachers and classmates about her condition, abilities, and special needs. A visit by the parents can be helpful, but unless the classmates are prepared for the changes, it alone will not prevent teasing. Kelly’s school experience should be normalized as much as possible.

        "Question": "A nurse is preparing to perform a dressing change on a 6-year-old child with mild cognitive impairment (CI) who sustained a minor burn. Which strategy should the nurse use to prepare the child for this procedure?",
        "Choice 1": "Verbally explain what will be done.",
        "Choice 2": "Have the child watch a video on dressing changes.",
        "Choice 3": "Demonstrate a dressing change on a doll.",
        "Choice 4": "Explain the importance of keeping the burn area clean.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Children with CI have a marked deficit in their ability to discriminate between two or more stimuli because of difficulty in recognizing the relevance of specific cues. However, these children can learn to discriminate if the cues are presented in an exaggerated, concrete form and if all extraneous stimuli are eliminated. Therefore, demonstration is preferable to verbal explanation, and learning should be directed toward mastering a skill rather than understanding the scientific principles underlying a procedure. Watching a video would require the use of both visual and auditory stimulation and might produce overload in the child with mild cognitive impairment. Explaining the importance of keeping the burn area clean would be too abstract for the child."

        "Choice 1": "It is too early to add solids; the parents should wait for 2 to 3 months.",
        "Choice 2": "A small but long, straight-handled spoon should be used to push the food toward the back and side of the mouth.",
        "Choice 3": "If the child thrusts the food out, the feeding should be stopped.",
        "Choice 4": "Solids should be offered only three times a day.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Down syndrome children have a protruding tongue which can interfere with feeding, especially of solid foods. Parents need to know that the tongue thrust is not an indication of refusal to feed but a physiologic response. Parents are advised to use a small but long, straight-handled spoon to push the food toward the back and side of the mouth. If food is thrust out, it should be re-fed. Six months is the time to introduce solid foods to a child, so waiting 2 to 3 months is inappropriate. Small frequent feedings should be initiated to prevent the child from tiring. Three times a day is too infrequent."

        "Choice 1": "Maintain a structured routine and keep stimulation to a minimum.",
        "Choice 2": "Place child in a room with a roommate of the same age.",
        "Choice 3": "Maintain frequent touch and eye contact with the child.",
        "Choice 4": "Take the child frequently to the playroom to play with other children.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Providing a structured routine for the child to follow is a key in the management of ASD. Decreasing stimulation by using a private room, avoiding extraneous auditory and visual distractions, and encouraging the parents to bring in possessions the child is attached to may lessen the disruptiveness of hospitalization. Because physical contact often upsets these children, minimum holding and eye contact may be necessary to avoid behavioral outbursts. Children with ASD need to be introduced slowly to new situations, with visits with staff caregivers kept short whenever possible. The playroom would be too overwhelming with new people and situations and should not be a priority of care."

        "Explanation": "These are three of the areas in which autistic children may show delayed or abnormal functioning: language as used in social communication, symbolic or imaginative play, and social interaction. Parallel play is typical play of toddlers and is usually not affected. Gross motor development and growth below the 5th percentile for height and weight are usually not characteristic of autism."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "2, 4, 5",
        "Explanation": "After enucleation surgery, the parents are prepared for the child’s facial appearance. An eye patch is in place, and the child’s face may be edematous or ecchymotic. Parents often fear seeing the surgical site because they imagine a cavity in the skull. A surgically implanted sphere maintains the shape of the eyeball, and the implant is covered with conjunctiva. When the eyelids are open, the exposed area resembles the mucosal lining of the mouth. The dressing, consisting of an eye pad taped over the surgical site, is changed daily. The wound itself is clean and has little or no drainage. So expecting a lot of drainage is not accurate to tell parents. The eyelids are not sutured shut after enucleation surgery."

Examples of primary prevention activities include well-child care clinics; immunization programs; safety programs (bike helmets, car seats, seat belts, childproof containers); nutrition programs; environmental efforts (clean air programs); sanitation measures (chlorinated water, garbage removal, sewage treatment); and community parenting classes. Teaching a child how to use an inhaler is tertiary prevention and conducting scoliosis screening exams is secondary prevention."

        "Question": "Home care is being considered for a young child who is ventilator-dependent. Which factor is most important in deciding whether home care is appropriate?",
        "Choice 1": "Level of parents’ education",
        "Choice 2": "Presence of two parents in the home",
        "Choice 3": "Preparation and training of family",
        "Choice 4": "Family’s ability to assume all health care costs",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "One of the essential elements is the family’s training and preparation. The family must be able to demonstrate all aspects of care for the child. In many areas, it cannot be guaranteed that nursing care will be available on a continual basis, and the family will have to care for the child. The amount of formal education reached by the parents is not the important issue. The determinant is the family’s ability to care adequately for the child in the home. At least two family members should learn and demonstrate all aspects of the child’s care in the hospital, but it does not have to be two parents. Few families can assume all health care costs. Creative financial planning, including negotiating arrangements with the insurance company and/or public programs, may be required."

        "Question": "The home health nurse asks a child’s mother many questions as part of the assessment. The mother answers many questions, then stops and says, “I don’t know why you ask me all this. Who gets to know this information?” The nurse should take which action?",
        "Choice 1": "Determine why the mother is so suspicious.",
        "Choice 2": "Determine what the mother does not want to tell.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Communication with the family should not be invasive. The nurse needs to explain the importance of collecting the information, its applicability to the child’s care, and who will have access to the information. The mother is not being suspicious and is not necessarily withholding important information. She has a right to understand how the information she provides will be used. The nurse will need to share, through both oral and written communication, clinically relevant information with other involved health professionals."

        "Explanation": "The nurse will need to share, through both oral and written communication, clinically relevant information with other involved health professionals. Asking others what they want to know and sharing everything known about the family is inappropriate. Patients have a right to confidentiality. The nurse is not permitted to share information about clients, except clinically relevant information that pertains to the child’s care. Confidentiality permits the disclosure of information to other health professionals on a need-to-know basis."

        "Choice 1": "Determine why family is easily frustrated.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The philosophic basis for family-centered practice is the recognition that the family is the constant in the child’s life. It is essential and appropriate that the family have complete and accurate information about their child’s illness and management. The nurse may first have to clarify what information the family believes has not been communicated. The family’s frustration arises from their perception that they are not receiving information pertinent to their child’s care. Referring the family to the child’s primary care practitioner does not help the family. The home health nurse should have access to the necessary information. Questions about what they need and want to know concerning their child’s care should be addressed."

        "Choice 1": "refuse to feed him orally because the risk is too high.",
        "Choice 2": "explain the risks involved, and then let the family decide what should be done.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Parents want to be included in the decision making for their child’s care. The nurse should discuss the request with the family to ensure this is the issue of concern, and then they can explore potential options together. Merely refusing to feed the child orally does not determine why the parents wish the oral feedings to begin and does not involve them in the problem solving. The decision to begin or not change feedings should be a collaborative one, made in consultation with the family, nurse, and appropriate member of the health care team."

        "Explanation": "In the home, the family is a partner in each step of the nursing process. Family priorities should guide the planning process. Both short- and long-term goals should be outlined and agreed on by the child, family, and professionals involved. Involvement of the individuals who are essential to the child’s care is necessary during this important stage. The elimination of any one of these groups can potentially create a care plan that does not meet the needs of the child and family."

        "Choice 1": "inappropriate, unless nurses are able to evaluate family.",

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Quality assessment and improvement activities are essential for virtually all organizations. Family involvement is essential in evaluating a home care plan and can occur on several levels. The nurse can ask the family open-ended questions at regular intervals to assess their opinion of the effectiveness of care. Families should also be given an opportunity to evaluate the individual home care nurses, the home care agency, and other service providers periodically. The nurse is the care provider. The evaluation is of the provision of care to the patient and family. The nurse’s role is not to evaluate the family. Quality-monitoring activities are required by virtually all health care agencies. During the evaluation process, the family is requested to provide their perceptions of care."

        "Question": "The home care nurse has been visiting an adolescent with recently acquired quadriplegia. The teen’s mother tells the nurse, “I’m sick of providing all the care while my husband does whatever he wants to, whenever he wants to do it.” Which should be the initial action of the nurse?",
        "Choice 1": "Refer mother for counseling.",
        "Choice 2": "Listen and reflect mother’s feelings.",
        "Choice 3": "Ask father, in private, why he does not help.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "It is appropriate for the nurse to reflect with the mother about her feelings, exploring issues such as an additional home health aide to help care for the child and provide respite for the mother. It is inappropriate for the nurse to agree with the mother that her husband is not helping enough. It is a judgment beyond the role of the nurse and can undermine the family relationship. Counseling is not necessary at this time. A support group for caregivers may be indicated. Asking the father why he does not help and suggesting ways to the mother to get her husband to help are interventions based on the mother’s assumption of minimal contribution to the child’s care. The father may have a full-time job and other commitments. The parents need to have an involved third person help them through the negotiation of responsibilities for the loss of their normal child and new parenting responsibilities."

        "Explanation": "A major principle for developmental support in children with complex medical issues is that it should be flexible and tailored to the individual child’s abilities, interests, and needs. This child is exhibiting readiness for ambulation. It is an appropriate time to provide activities that encourage mobility, for example, longer oxygen tubing. Parents should provide decreasing amounts of assistance with self-care as he is able to develop these skills. He is receiving oral foods and is eating finger foods. He has acquired oral-motor development. Mobility is a new developmental task. Opportunities for socialization should be ongoing."

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Respite care provides temporary relief to parents and allows a break from the responsibilities of caring for the ventilator-dependent child on a daily basis. For example, a trusted and trained grandparent or extended family member may be called in to give the family a break from caring for the child. Members of the parent’s church group would not have the training necessary to care for a ventilator-dependent child.

        "Explanation": "Hand hygiene is the cornerstone of infection control, and the nurse should teach parents the practice and help identify appropriate areas in the home setting for hand hygiene to be carried out with ease. Equipment can be cleaned in the home setting, but there is no means to sterilize equipment and because the child is exposed to fewer organisms in the home setting use of sterile equipment on a daily basis is not warranted. Some medical equipment may be washed with an appropriate disinfectant and reused to decrease cost of care; however, appropriate infection control practices should not be compromised to save money.

        "Choice 1": "Explain hospital schedules to her, such as mealtimes.",
        "Choice 2": "Use terms such as “honey” and “dear” to show a caring attitude.",
        "Choice 3": "Explain when parents can visit and why siblings cannot come to see her.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "School-age children need to have control of their environment. The nurse should offer explanations or prepare the child for those experiences that are unavailable. The nurse should refer to the child by the preferred name. Explaining when parents can visit and why siblings cannot come to see her is telling the child all of the limitations, not helping her adjust to the hospital. At the age of 8 years, the child should be oriented to the environment along with the parents."

        "Choice 1": "New toys make hospitalization easier.",
        "Choice 2": "New toys are usually better than older ones for children of this age.",
        "Choice 3": "At this age, children often need the comfort and reassurance of familiar toys from home.",
        "Choice 4": "Buying new toys for a hospitalized child is a maladaptive way to cope with parental guilt.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Parents should bring favorite items from home to be with the child. Young children associate inanimate objects with people who are significant in their lives. The favorite items will comfort and reassure the child. Because the parents left the objects, the preschooler knows the parents will return. New toys will not serve the purpose of familiar toys and objects from home. The parents may experience some guilt as a response to the hospitalization, but there is no evidence that it is maladaptive."

I should have taken him to the doctor sooner so he wouldn’t have to be here.” Which is appropriate in the care plan for this parent who is experiencing guilt?",
        "Choice 1": "Clarify misconception about the illness.",
        "Choice 2": "Explain to parent that the illness is not serious.",
        "Choice 3": "Encourage parent to maintain a sense of control.",
        "Choice 4": "Assess further why parent has excessive guilt feelings.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Guilt is a common response of parents when a child is hospitalized. They may blame themselves for the child’s illness or for not recognizing it soon enough. The nurse should clarify the nature of the problem and reassure parents that the child is being cared for. Croup is a potentially serious illness. The nurse should not minimize the parent’s feelings. It would be difficult for the parent to maintain a sense of control while the child is seriously ill. No further assessment is indicated at this time; guilt is a common response for parents."

        "Question": "A 14-year-old boy is being admitted to the hospital for an appendectomy. Which roommate should the nurse assign with this patient?",
        "Choice 1": "A 4-year-old boy with first day post-appendectomy surgery",
        "Choice 2": "A 6-year-old boy with pneumonia",
        "Choice 3": "A 15-year-old boy admitted with a vasoocclusive sickle cell crisis",
        "Choice 4": "A 12-year-old boy with cellulitis",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "When a child is admitted, nurses follow several fairly universal admission procedures. The minimum considerations for room assignment are age, sex, and nature of the illness. Age grouping is especially important for adolescents. The 14-year-old boy being admitted to the unit after appendectomy surgery should be placed with a noninfectious child of the same sex and age. The 15-year-old child with sickle cell is the best choice. The 4-year-old post-appendectomy is too young, and the child with pneumonia is too young and possibly has an infectious process. The 12-year-old boy with cellulitis is the right age, but he has an infection (cellulitis)."

        "Choice 1": "“I wish my parents could spend the night with me while I am in the hospital.”",
        "Choice 2": "“I think I would like for my siblings to visit me but not my friends.”",
        "Choice 3": "“I hope my friends don’t forget about visiting me.”",
        "Choice 4": "“I will be embarrassed if my friends come to the hospital to visit.”",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Loss of peer-group contact may pose a severe emotional threat to an adolescent because of loss of group status, so friends visiting are an important aspect of hospitalization for an adolescent. Most adolescents do not need a parent to spend the night during hospitalization and sometimes view the hospitalization as a welcome event. Adolescents would be more concerned about friends visiting than siblings. Adolescents want visitors to keep control and maintain social status among their group of peers."

        "Question": "A nurse is preparing to complete an admission assessment on a 2-year-old child. The child is sitting on the parent’s lap. Which technique should the nurse implement to complete the physical exam?",
        "Choice 1": "Ask the parent to place the child in the hospital crib.",
        "Choice 2": "Take the child and parent to the exam room.",
        "Choice 3": "Perform the exam while the child is on the parent’s lap.",
        "Choice 4": "Ask the child to stand by the parent while completing the exam.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The nurse should complete the exam while the child is on the parent’s lap. For young children, particularly infants and toddlers, preserving parent–child contact is the best means of decreasing the need for or stress of restraint. The entire physical examination can be done in a parent’s lap with the parent hugging the child for procedures such as an otoscopic examination. Placing the child in the crib, taking the child to the exam room, or asking the child to stand by the parent would separate the child from the parent and cause anxiety."

        "Question": "A school-age child, admitted for intravenous antibiotic therapy for osteomyelitis, reports difficulty in going to sleep at night. Which intervention should the nurse implement to assist the child in going to sleep at bedtime?",
        "Choice 1": "Request a prescription for a sleeping pill.",
        "Choice 2": "Allow the child to stay up late and sleep late in the morning.",
        "Choice 3": "Create a schedule similar to the one the child follows at home.",
        "Choice 4": "Plan passive activities in the morning and interactive activities right before bedtime.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Many children obtain significantly less sleep in the hospital than at home; the primary causes are a delay in sleep onset and early termination of sleep because of hospital routines. One technique that can minimize the disruption in the child’s routine is establishing a daily schedule. This approach is most suitable for non–critically ill school-age and adolescent children who have mastered the concept of time. It involves scheduling the child’s day to include all those activities that are important to the child and nurse, such as treatment procedures, schoolwork, exercise, television, playroom, and hobbies. The school-age child with osteomyelitis would benefit from a schedule similar to the one followed at home. Requesting a prescription for a sleeping pill would be inappropriate and allowing the child to stay up late and sleep late would not be keeping the child in a routine followed at home. Passive activities in the morning and interactive activities at bedtime should be reversed; it would be better to keep the child active in the morning hours and plan quiet activities at bedtime."

        "Choice 1": "Regression is seen during hospitalization.",
        "Choice 2": "Developmental delays occur because of the hospitalization.",
        "Choice 3": "The child is experiencing urinary urgency because of hospitalization.",
        "Choice 4": "The child was too young to be “potty-trained.”",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Regression is expected and normal for all age groups when hospitalized. Nurses should assure the parents this is temporary and the child will return to the previously mastered developmental milestone when back home. This does not indicate a developmental delay. The child should not be experiencing urinary urgency because of hospitalization and this would not be normal. Successful “potty-training” can be started at 2 years of age if the child is ready."

        "Choice 1": "Take the blood pressure in the playroom.",
        "Choice 2": "Ask the child to come to the exam room to obtain the blood pressure.",
        "Choice 3": "Ask the child to return to his or her room for the blood pressure, then escort the child back to the playroom.",

        "Explanation": "The play room is a safe haven for children, free from medical or nursing procedures. The child can be returned to his or her room for the blood pressure and then escorted back to the playroom. The exam room is reserved for painful procedures that should not be performed in the child’s hospital bed.

        "Choice 1": "None, this is an emergency and the child should not participate in care.",
        "Choice 2": "Allow the child to hold the digital thermometer while taking the child’s blood pressure.",
        "Choice 3": "Ask the child if it is OK to take a temperature in the ear.",
        "Choice 4": "Have parents wait in the waiting room.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The nurse should allow the child to hold the digital thermometer while taking the child’s blood pressure. Unless an emergency is life threatening, children need to participate in their care to maintain a sense of control. Because emergency departments are frequently hectic, there is a tendency to rush through procedures to save time. However, the extra few minutes needed to allow children to participate may save many more minutes of useless resistance and uncooperativeness during subsequent procedures. The child may not give permission, if asked, for a procedure that is necessary to be performed. It is better to give choices such as, “Which ear do you want me to do your temperature in?” instead of, “Can I take your temperature?” Parents should remain with their child to help with decreasing the child’s anxiety."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The major stress from middle infancy throughout the preschool years, especially for children ages 6 to 30 months, is separation anxiety, also called anaclitic depression. During the stage of protest, children react aggressively to the separation from the parent. They cry and scream for their parents, refuse the attention of anyone else, and are inconsolable in their grief. When the parent leaves even for a short time this is the expected reaction and the figure that depicts the child not wanting the parent to leave is what the nurse should expect as a reaction from the child. The child sitting alone sadly depicts a child in the despair stage. In this stage depression is evident. The child is much less active, is uninterested in play or food, and withdraws from others. The child sitting on the parent’s lap is withdrawn and sad, even in the presence of the parent. The child depicted playing a game is adjusting to the hospitalization with play."

        "Answer": "1, 3, 5",
        "Explanation": "Intensive care units, especially when the family is unprepared for the admission, are a strange and unfamiliar place with many pieces of unfamiliar equipment. The sights and sounds are much different from those of a general hospital unit. Also, with the child’s condition being more precarious, it may be difficult to keep the parents updated and knowledgeable about what is happening. Lights are usually on around the clock, seriously disrupting the diurnal rhythm. There is usually little privacy available for families in intensive care units."

        "Answer": "2, 3, 4",
        "Explanation": "Therapeutic play is an effective, nondirective modality for helping children deal with their concerns and fears, and at the same time, it often helps the nurse gain insights into children’s needs and feelings. Play and other expressive activities provide one of the best opportunities for encouraging emotional expression, including the safe release of anger and hostility. Nondirective play that allows children freedom for expression can be tremendously therapeutic. Play therapy is a structured therapy that helps disturbed children. It should not be confused with therapeutic play."

        "Explanation": "The discharge interventions a nurse should implement when a child is being discharged from an ambulatory care center should include dietary restrictions, being very specific and giving examples of “clear fluids” or what is meant by a “full liquid diet.” The nurse should give specific information on pain control and send a pain scale home with the family. All complications that may occur after an inguinal hernia repair should be discussed with the parents.

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Most fevers are of brief duration, with limited consequences, and are viral. Little evidence supports the use of antipyretic drugs to prevent febrile seizures.

        "Explanation": "Unlike with fever, antipyretics are of no value in hyperthermia because the set point is already normal. Cooling measures are used instead. Malignant hyperthermia is a genetic myopathy that is triggered by anesthetic agents. Antipyretic agents do not have this effect.

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Environmental measures such as sponge baths can be used to reduce temperature if tolerated by the child and if they do not induce shivering. Shivering is the body’s way of maintaining the elevated set point. Compensatory shivering increases metabolic requirements above those already caused by the fever. Ice water and isopropyl alcohol are potentially dangerous solutions. Fans should not be used because of the risk of the child developing vasoconstriction, which defeats the purpose of the cooling measures. Little blood is carried to the skin surface, and the blood remains primarily in the viscera to become heated. The child is placed in a tub of tepid water for 20 to 30 minutes."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Because of the urgency of the child’s condition, conscious sedation should be used for the procedure. Pediatric spinal trays have smaller needles than do adult trays. Reassuring the parents that the test is simple, painless, and risk free is incorrect information. A spinal tap does have associated risks, and analgesia will be given for the pain.

        "Explanation": "To obtain small amounts of urine, use a syringe without a needle to aspirate urine directly from the diaper. If diapers with absorbent material are used, place a small gauze dressing or cotton balls inside the diaper to collect the urine, and aspirate the urine with a syringe. For frequent urine sampling, the collection bag would be too irritating to the child’s skin. It is not feasible to tape a small medicine cup to inside of diaper; the urine will spill from the cup.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The anxiety, fear, and discomfort experienced during catheterization can be significantly decreased by preparation of the child and parents, by selection of the correct catheter, and by appropriate technique of insertion. Generous lubrication of the urethra before catheterization and use of lubricant containing 2% lidocaine may reduce or eliminate the burning and discomfort associated with this procedure. Catheterization is a sterile procedure, and standard precautions for body-substance protection should be followed. Water-soluble lubricants do not provide appropriate local anesthesia.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Before the blood sample is taken, the heel is heated with warm moist compresses for 5 to 10 minutes to dilate the blood vessels in the area. Cooling causes vasoconstriction, making blood collection more difficult. A tourniquet is used to constrict superficial veins. It will have an insignificant effect on capillaries.

        "Choice 4": "Long-term central venous access is not possible.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "In situations in which rapid establishment of systemic access is vital and venous access is hampered, such as peripheral circulatory collapse and hypovolemic shock, intraosseous infusion provides a rapid, safe, lifesaving alternative. The procedure is painful, and local anesthetics and systemic analgesics are given. Antibiotics could be given when vascular access is obtained. Long-term central venous access is time-consuming, and intraosseous infusion is used in an emergency situation."

        "Choice 4": "observe the insertion site frequently for signs of infiltration.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The nursing responsibility for IV therapy is to calculate the amount to be infused in a given length of time; set the infusion rate; and monitor the apparatus frequently (at least every 1 to 2 hours) to make certain that the desired rate is maintained, the integrity of the system remains intact, the site remains intact (free of redness, edema, infiltration, or irritation), and the infusion does not stop. A minidropper (60 drops/ml) is the recommended IV tubing in pediatrics. The IV site should be protected. This may require soft restraints on the child. Insertion sites do not need to be changed every 24 hours unless a problem is found with the site. This exposes the child to significant trauma."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Oxygen is a prescribed medication. It is the nurse’s responsibility to ensure that the ordered concentration is delivered and the effects of therapy are monitored. Oxygen is drying to the tissues. Oxygen should always be humidified when delivered to a patient. A child receiving oxygen therapy should have the oxygen saturation monitored at least as frequently as vital signs. Oxygen is a medication, and it is the responsibility of the practitioner to modify dosage as indicated. Humidified oxygen should not be blown directly into an infant’s face."

        "Choice 4": "burns under sensors.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "It is important to make certain that sensor connectors and oximeters are compatible. Wiring that is incompatible can generate considerable heat at the tip of the sensor, causing second- and third-degree burns under the sensor. Incompatibility would cause a local irritation or burn. A low voltage is used, which should not present risk of electrocution. Pressure necrosis can occur from the sensor being attached too tightly, but this is not a problem of incompatibility."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "For postural drainage and percussion, the child should be dressed in a light shirt to protect the skin and placed in the appropriate postural drainage positions. The chest wall is struck with a cupped-hand, not a flat-hand position. The procedure should be done over the rib cage only. Positioning precedes the percussion."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Suctioning should require no longer than 5 seconds per pass. Otherwise, the airway may be occluded for too long. If the child is able to cough up secretions, suctioning may not be indicated. The catheter should have a diameter one half the size of the tracheostomy tube. If it is too large, it might block the child’s airway. The child is allowed to rest for 30 to 60 seconds after each aspiration to allow oxygen tension to return to normal. Then the process is repeated until the trachea is clear."

        "Explanation": "Position the child with the head elevated about 30 degrees and on the right side or abdomen for at least 1 hour. This is in the same manner as after any infant feeding to minimize the possibility of regurgitation and aspiration. Insert a tube that has been lubricated with sterile water or water-soluble lubricant.

        "Explanation": "Isotonic solutions should be used in children. Saline is the solution of choice. Plain water is not used. This is a hypotonic solution and can cause rapid fluid shift, resulting in fluid overload. Oil-retention enemas will not achieve the “until clear” result. Fleet enemas are not advised for children because of the harsh action of the ingredients. The osmotic effects of the Fleet enema can result in diarrhea, which can lead to metabolic acidosis."

        "Explanation": "The advantages of the ventrogluteal are being less painful, free of important nerves and vascular lateralis, and is easily identified by major landmarks. The major disadvantage is lack of familiarity by health professionals and controversy over whether the site can be used before weight bearing. The use of the ventrogluteal has not been clarified. It has been used in infants, but clinical guidelines address the need for the child to be walking, thus generally being over 20 pounds.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The family’s presence will decrease the child’s distress. It is true that mothers of hospitalized toddlers often experience guilt but this is not the best answer. The main reason to keep parents at the child’s bedside is to ease anxiety and therefore respiratory effort. The child should have constant monitoring by cardiorespiratory monitor and noninvasive oxygen saturation monitoring, but the parent should not play this role in the hospital."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The inability to speak is indicative of a foreign-body airway obstruction of the larynx. Abdominal thrusts are needed for treatment of the choking child. Gagging indicates irritation at the back of the throat, not obstruction. Coughing does not indicate a complete airway obstruction. Tachycardia may be present for many reasons."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "In bronchial asthma, spasm of the smooth muscle of the bronchi and bronchioles causes constriction, producing impaired respiratory function. In bronchial asthma, there is increased resistance in the airway. There are multiple causes of asthma, including allergens, irritants, exercise, cold air, infections, medications, medical conditions, and endocrine factors. Atopy or development of an immunoglobulin E (IgE)–mediated response is inherited but is not the only cause of asthma."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "2, 3, 5",
        "Explanation": "Nursing care of the child with a chest tube requires close attention to respiratory status; the chest tube and drainage device used are monitored for proper function (i.e., drainage is not impeded, vacuum setting is correct, tubing is free of kinks, dressing covering chest tube insertion site is intact, water seal is maintained, and chest tube remains in place). Movement in bed and ambulation with a chest tube are encouraged according to the child’s respiratory status, but children require frequent doses of analgesia. Supplemental oxygen may be required in the acute phase of the illness and may be administered by nasal cannula, face mask, flow-by, or face tent. The child should be positioned on the left side, not the right. Lying on the affected side if the pneumonia is unilateral (“good lung up”) splints the chest on that side and reduces the pleural rubbing that often causes discomfort. The chest tube should never be clamped; this can cause a pneumothorax. The chest tube should be maintained to the underwater seal at all times."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Most children with Hirschsprung disease require surgical rather than medical management. Surgery is done to remove the aganglionic portion of the bowel, relieve obstruction, and restore normal bowel motility and function of the internal anal sphincter. Preoperative management may include enemas and low-fiber, high-calorie, high-protein diet, until the child is physically ready for surgery. The colostomy that is created in Hirschsprung disease is usually temporary."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Isotonic solutions should be used in children. Saline is the solution of choice. Plain water is not used. This is a hypotonic solution and can cause rapid fluid shift, resulting in fluid overload. Oil-retention enemas will not achieve the “until clear” result. Phosphate enemas are not advised for children because of the harsh action of the ingredients. The osmotic effects of the phosphate enema can result in diarrhea, which can lead to metabolic acidosis."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The child’s age dictates the type and extent of psychological preparation. When a colostomy is performed, the child who is at least preschool age is told about the procedure and what to expect in concrete terms, with the use of visual aids. It is necessary to prepare a 3-year-old child for procedures. The preschooler is not yet concerned with body image."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "It is important to emphasize the need for the child to brush the teeth or rinse the mouth after vomiting to dilute the hydrochloric acid that comes in contact with the teeth. Ad libitum administration of glucose-electrolyte solution to an alert child will help restore water and electrolytes satisfactorily. It is important to include carbohydrate to spare body protein and avoid ketosis."

        "Choice 4": "Give larger, less frequent feedings.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Small, frequent feedings of formula combined with 1 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon of rice cereal per ounce of formula has been recommended. Milk-thickening agents have been shown to decrease the number of episodes of vomiting and to increase the caloric density of the formula. This may benefit infants who are underweight as a result of GER disease. Placing the child in a Trendelenburg position would increase the reflux. Continuous nasogastric feedings are reserved for infants with severe reflux and failure to thrive."

        "Explanation": "The mechanism of action of histamine-receptor antagonists is to reduce the amount of acid present in gastric contents and perhaps prevent esophagitis. Preventing reflux or hematemesis and increasing gastric acid production are not the modes of action of histamine-receptor antagonists."

Rebound tenderness is not a reliable sign and is extremely painful to the child. Bright red or dark red rectal bleeding and abdominal pain that is relieved by eating are not signs of acute appendicitis."

        "Explanation": "The child should be allowed to take a position of comfort, usually with the legs flexed. The Trendelenburg position will not help with the discomfort. In any instance in which appendicitis is a possibility, there is a danger in administering a laxative or enemas or applying heat to the area.

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The chronic inflammatory process of Crohn disease involves any part of the GI tract from the mouth to the anus but most often affects the terminal ileum. Crohn disease involves all layers of the bowel wall in a discontinuous fashion, meaning that between areas of intact mucosa, there are areas of affected mucosa (skip lesions). The inflammation found with ulcerative colitis is limited to the colon and rectum, with the distal colon and rectum the most severely affected. Inflammation affects the mucosa and submucosa and involves continuous segments along the length of the bowel with varying degrees of ulceration, bleeding, and edema."

        "Explanation": "For parents, cleft lip and cleft palate deformities are particularly disturbing. The nurse must place emphasize not only the infant’s physical needs but also the parents’ emotional needs. The mother needs to be able to express her feelings before she can accept her child. Although the nurse will restate what the physician has told the mother about plastic surgery, it is not part of the initial therapeutic approach. As the mother expresses her feelings, the nurse’s actions should convey to the parents that the infant is a precious human being.

        "Explanation": "The mother who wishes to breastfeed may need encouragement and support because the defect does present some logistical issues. The nipple must be positioned and stabilized well back in the infant’s oral cavity so that the tongue action facilitates milk expression. Because breastfeeding is an option, if the mother wishes to breastfeed, medications should not be given to suppress lactation. Because breastfeeding can usually be accomplished, gavage feedings are not indicated.

        "Explanation": "When a newborn is suspected of having a tracheoesophageal fistula, the most desirable position is supine with the head elevated on an inclined plane of at least 30 degrees. It is imperative that any source of aspiration be removed at once; oral feedings are withheld. Feedings should not be given to infants suspected of having tracheoesophageal fistulas.

        "Choice 4": "intussusception.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Intussusception occurs when a proximal section of the bowel telescopes into a more distal segment, pulling the mesentery with it. The mesentery is compressed and angled, resulting in lymphatic and venous obstruction. Invagination of one segment of bowel within another is the definition of intussusception, not atresia, stenosis, or herniation."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The main consideration is helping the child adhere to dietary management. Considerable time is spent explaining to the child and parents about the disease process, the specific role of gluten in aggravating the condition, and foods that must be restricted. Referral to a nutritionist would help in this process. The most severe symptoms usually occur in early childhood and adult life. Dietary avoidance of gluten should be lifelong. Celiac disease is not transmissible or stress related."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "During TPN therapy, care must be taken to minimize the risk of complications related to the central venous access device, such as catheter infections, occlusions, or accidental removal. This is an important part of family teaching. The prognosis for patients with short bowel syndrome depends in part on the length of residual small intestine. It has improved with advances in TPN. Although parents need to be taught about nutritional needs, the caloric needs and prescribed TPN and rate are the responsibility of the health care team. The tubes should not be placed under the diaper due to risk of infection."

        "Question": "A nurse is receiving report on a newborn admitted yesterday after a gastroschisis repair. In the report, the nurse is told the newborn has a physician’s prescription for an NG tube to low intermittent suction. The reporting nurse confirms that the NG tube is to low intermittent suction and draining light green stomach contents. Upon initial assessment, the nurse notes that the newborn has pulled the NG tube out. Which is the priority action the nurse should take?",
        "Choice 1": "Replace the NG tube and continue the low intermittent suction.",
        "Choice 2": "Leave the NG tube out and notify the physician at the end of the shift.",
        "Choice 3": "Leave the NG tube out and monitor for bowel sounds.",
        "Choice 4": "Replace the NG tube, but leave to gravity drainage instead of low wall suction.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "A newborn with a gastroschisis performed the day before will require bowel decompression with an NG tube to low wall intermittent suction. The nurse’s priority action is to replace the NG tube and continue with the low wall intermittent suctioning. The NG tube cannot be left out this soon after surgery. The physician’s prescription was to have the NG tube to low wall intermittent suction so the tube cannot be placed to gravity drainage."

        "Choice 1": "“Yes, the only way to know the H. pylori has been eradicated is with another endoscopy.”",
        "Choice 2": "“We can collect a stool sample and confirm that the H. pylori has been eradicated.”",
        "Choice 3": "“A blood test can be done to determine that the H. pylori is no longer present.”",
        "Choice 4": "“Your child will always test positive for H. pylori because after treatment it goes into remission, but can’t be completely eradicated.”",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "An upper endoscopy is the procedure initially performed to diagnose PUD. A biopsy can determine the presence of H. pylori. Polyclonal and monoclonal stool antigen tests are an accurate, noninvasive method to confirm H. pylori has been eradicated after treatment. A blood test can identify the presence of the antigen to this organism, but because H. pylori was already present it would not be as accurate as a stool sample to determine whether it has been eradicated. H. pylori can be treated and, once the treatment is complete, the stool sample can determine that it was eradicated."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Treatment for RAP involves providing reassurance and reducing or eliminating symptoms. Dietary modifications may include removal of dairy products to rule out lactose intolerance. Fructose is eliminated to rule out sensitivity to high sugar content and gluten is removed to rule out celiac disease. A dairy-free diet would not rule out peptic ulcer disease."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 4, 5",
        "Explanation": "Wound care instruction is necessary in a child who is being discharged after surgery. The parents are taught to notify the practitioner if any signs of an anal stricture or other complications develop. Constipation is avoided, since a firm stool will place strain on the suture line. Fiber and stool softeners are often given to keep stools soft and avoid tension on the suture line. The child needs to recover from the surgical procedure. Then bowel training may begin, depending on the child’s developmental and physiologic readiness."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "2, 3, 4, 6",
        "Explanation": "The vaccine elicits the formation of an antibody to the hepatitis B surface antigen, which is protective against hepatitis B. Hepatitis B can be transferred to an infant of a breastfeeding mother, especially if the mother’s nipples are cracked. The onset of hepatitis B is insidious. Immunity develops after one exposure to hepatitis B. Hepatitis B has a carrier state. The fecal-oral route is the principal mode of transmission for hepatitis A.

        "Question": "A nurse is planning preoperative care for a newborn with tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF). Which interventions should the nurse plan to implement? (Select all that apply.)",
        "Choice 1": "Positioning with head elevated on a 30-degree plane",
        "Choice 2": "Feedings through a gastrostomy tube",
        "Choice 3": "Nasogastric tube to continuous low wall suction",
        "Choice 4": "Suctioning with a Replogle tube passed orally to the end of the pouch",
        "Choice 5": "Gastrostomy tube to gravity drainage",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 4, 5",
        "Explanation": "The most desirable position for a newborn who has TEF is supine (or sometimes prone) with the head elevated on an inclined plane of at least 30 degrees. This positioning minimizes the reflux of gastric secretions at the distal esophagus into the trachea and bronchi, especially when intraabdominal pressure is elevated. It is imperative to immediately remove any secretions that can be aspirated. Until surgery, the blind pouch is kept empty by intermittent or continuous suction through an indwelling double-lumen or Replogle catheter passed orally or nasally to the end of the pouch. In some cases, a percutaneous gastrostomy tube is inserted and left open so that any air entering the stomach through the fistula can escape, thus minimizing the danger of gastric contents being regurgitated into the trachea. The gastrostomy tube is emptied by gravity drainage. Feedings through the gastrostomy tube and irrigations with fluid are contraindicated before surgery in an infant with a distal TEF. A nasogastric tube to low intermittent suctioning could not be accomplished because the esophagus ends in a blind pouch in TEF."

        "Explanation": "Feedings are usually instituted soon after a pyloromyotomy surgery, beginning with clear liquids advancing to formula or breast milk as tolerated. IV fluids are administered until the infant is taking and retaining adequate amounts by mouth. Appropriate analgesics should be given around the clock because pain is continuous. Ice should not be applied to the incisional area as it vasoconstricts and would reduce circulation to the incisional area and impair healing."

If this is surgically closed, no additional oxygenated blood (from the aorta) will return to the lungs through the pulmonary artery. The aorta carries oxygenated blood to the systemic circulation. Because of the higher pressure in the aorta, blood is shunted into the pulmonary artery and the pulmonary circulation. Edema in the legs and feet is usually a sign of heart failure. This repair would not directly affect the edema. Increasing the oxygenation of blood would not interfere with the return of oxygenated blood to the lungs."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The metabolic rate of infants with heart failure is greater because of poor cardiac function and increased heart and respiratory rates. Their caloric needs are greater than those of the average infants, yet their ability to take in the calories is diminished by their fatigue. Infants with heart failure should be fed every 3 hours; a 2-hour schedule does not allow for enough rest, and a 4-hour schedule is too long. Fluids must be carefully monitored because of the heart failure. Infants do not require supplemental oxygen with feedings."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The infant requires rest and conservation of energy for feeding. Every effort is made to organize nursing activities to allow for uninterrupted periods of sleep. Whenever possible, parents are encouraged to stay with their infant to provide the holding, rocking, and cuddling that help children sleep more soundly. To minimize disturbing the infant, changing bed linens and complete bathing are done only when necessary. Feeding is planned to accommodate the infant’s sleep and wake patterns. The child is fed at the first sign of hunger, such as when sucking on fists, rather than waiting until he or she cries for a bottle because the stress of crying exhausts the limited energy supply. Because infants with CHD tire easily and may sleep through feedings, smaller feedings every 3 hours may be helpful."

The infant becomes acutely cyanotic and hyperpneic because sudden infundibular spasm decreases pulmonary blood flow and increases right-to-left shunting. Because profound hypoxemia causes cerebral hypoxia, hypercyanotic spells require prompt assessment and treatment to prevent brain damage or possibly death. The infant should first be placed in the knee-chest position to reduce blood returning to the heart. Next 100% oxygen is given to alleviate the hypoxemia.

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "In iron deficiency anemia, the child’s clinical appearance is a result of the anemia, not the underlying cause. Usually the hematopoietic system is not depressed in iron deficiency anemia. The bone marrow produces red cells that are smaller and contain less hemoglobin than normal red cells. Children who are iron deficient from drinking excessive quantities of milk are usually pale and overweight. They are receiving sufficient calories, but are deficient in essential nutrients.

        "Explanation": "The nurse should prepare the mother for the anticipated change in the child’s stools. If the iron dose is adequate, the stools will become a tarry green color. The lack of the color change may indicate insufficient iron. The iron should be given in two divided doses between meals when the presence of free hydrochloric acid is greatest. Iron is absorbed best in an acidic environment. Vomiting and diarrhea may occur with iron administration. If these occur, the iron should be given with meals, and the dosage reduced, then gradually increased as the child develops tolerance. Liquid preparations of iron stain the teeth.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "A metabolite of meperidine, normeperidine, is a central nervous system stimulant that produces anxiety, tremors, myoclonus, and generalized seizures when it accumulates with repetitive dosing. Patients with sickle cell disease are particularly at risk for normeperidine-induced seizures. Meperidine is no more addictive than other narcotic agents. Meperidine is adequate for pain relief. It is available for IV infusion."

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The management of crises includes adequate hydration, minimization of energy expenditures, pain management, electrolyte replacement, and blood component therapy if indicated. Hydration and pain control are two of the major goals of therapy. The acidosis will be corrected as the crisis is treated. Heparin and factor VIII is not indicated in the treatment of vasoocclusive sickle cell crisis. Oxygen may prevent further sickling, but it is not effective in reversing sickling because it cannot reach the clogged blood vessels."

        "Question": "The parents of a child hospitalized with sickle cell anemia tell the nurse that they are concerned about narcotic analgesics causing addiction. Which is appropriate for the nurse to explain about narcotic analgesics?",
        "Choice 1": "Are often ordered but not usually needed",
        "Choice 2": "Rarely cause addiction because they are medically indicated",
        "Choice 3": "Are given as a last resort because of the threat of addiction",
        "Choice 4": "Are used only if other measures, such as ice packs, are ineffective",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The pain of sickle cell anemia is best treated by a multidisciplinary approach. Mild to moderate pain can be controlled by ibuprofen and acetaminophen. When narcotics are indicated, they are titrated to effect and are given around the clock. Patient-controlled analgesia reinforces the patient’s role and responsibility in managing the pain and provides flexibility in dealing with pain. Few, if any, patients who receive opioids for severe pain become behaviorally addicted to the drug. Narcotics are often used because of the severe nature of the pain of vasoocclusive crisis. Ice is contraindicated because of its vasoconstrictive effects."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "A complication of the frequent blood transfusions in thalassemia is iron overload. Chelation therapy with deferoxamine (an iron-chelating agent) is given with oral supplements of vitamin C to increase iron excretion. Chelation therapy treats the side effect of the disease management. Decreasing the risk of hypoxia and managing nausea and vomiting are not the purposes of chelation therapy."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The inheritance pattern in 80% of all of the cases of hemophilia is X-linked recessive. The two most common forms of the disorder are factor VIII deficiency, hemophilia A or classic hemophilia; and factor IX deficiency, hemophilia B or Christmas disease. The inheritance pattern is X-linked recessive. The disorder involves coagulation factors, not platelets, and does not involve red cells or the Y chromosomes."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Leukemia is a group of malignant disorders of the bone marrow and lymphatic system. It is defined as an unrestricted proliferation of immature WBCs in the blood-forming tissues of the body. Increased blood viscosity may occur secondary to the increased number of WBCs. Thrombocytopenia may occur secondary to the overproduction of WBCs in the bone marrow. The coagulation process is unaffected by leukemia."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The invasion of the bone marrow with leukemic cells gradually causes a weakening of the bone and a tendency toward fractures. As leukemic cells invade the periosteum, increasing pressure causes severe pain. Edema, petechial hemorrhages, and changes within the muscles would not cause severe pain."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The most beneficial regimen to minimize nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy is to administer the antiemetic before the chemotherapy is begun. The goal is to prevent anticipatory symptoms. Drinking fluids will add to the discomfort of the nausea and vomiting. Remaining until nausea and vomiting subside will help with this episode, but the child will have the discomfort and be at risk for dehydration. Administering an antiemetic as soon as the child has nausea does not prevent anticipatory nausea."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "2, 3, 4",
        "Explanation": "Nurses should take special precautions when caring for a child with hemophilia to prevent the use of procedures that may cause bleeding, such as IM injections. The subcutaneous route is substituted for IM injections whenever possible. Venipunctures for blood samples are usually preferred for these children. There is usually less bleeding after the venipuncture than after finger or heel punctures. Neither aspirin nor any aspirin-containing compound should be used. Acetaminophen is a suitable aspirin substitute, especially for controlling mild pain. A soft toothbrush is recommended for dental hygiene to prevent bleeding from the gums. Packed red blood cells are not administered. The primary therapy for hemophilia is replacement of the missing clotting factor. The products available are factor VIII concentrates."

        "Explanation": "Because almost all persons with hemophilia are boys, the physical limitations in regard to active sports may be a difficult adjustment, and activity restrictions must be tempered with sensitivity to the child’s emotional and physical needs. Use of protective equipment, such as padding and helmets, is particularly important, and noncontact sports, especially swimming, walking, jogging, tennis, golf, fishing, and bowling, are encouraged. Contact sport such as soccer and basketball are not recommended."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "2, 3, 5",
        "Explanation": "The most important issues to teach the family of a child with sickle cell anemia are to (1) seek early intervention for problems, such as a fever of 38.5° C (101.3° F) or greater; (2) give penicillin as ordered; (3) recognize signs and symptoms of splenic sequestration, as well as respiratory problems that can lead to hypoxia; and (4) treat the child normally. The nurse emphasizes the importance of adequate hydration to prevent sickling and to delay the adhesion–stasis–thrombosis–ischemia cycle. It is not sufficient to advise parents to “force fluids” or “encourage drinking.” They need specific instructions on how many daily glasses or bottles of fluid are required. Many foods are also a source of fluid, particularly soups, flavored ice pops, ice cream, sherbet, gelatin, and puddings. Increased fluids combined with impaired kidney function result in the problem of enuresis. Parents who are unaware of this fact frequently use the usual measures to discourage bedwetting, such as limiting fluids at night. Enuresis is treated as a complication of the disease, such as joint pain or some other symptom, to alleviate parental pressure on the child. Ice should not be used during a vasoocclusive pain crisis because it vasoconstricts and impairs circulation even more."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Glomerulonephritis has a decreased filtration of plasma, which results in an excessive accumulation of water and sodium that expands plasma and interstitial fluid volumes, leading to circulatory congestion and edema. No malignant process is involved in acute glomerulonephritis. A fluid volume excess is found. The fluid accumulation is secondary to the decreased plasma filtration."

        "Choice 4": "Periodic and irregular breathing",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Periodic or irregular breathing is an ominous sign of brainstem (especially medullary) dysfunction that often precedes complete apnea. Papilledema is edema and inflammation of optic nerve. It is commonly a sign of increased ICP. Delirium is a state of mental confusion and excitement marked by disorientation for time and place. The doll’s head maneuver is a test for brainstem or oculomotor nerve dysfunction."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The oculovestibular response (caloric test) involves the instillation of ice water into the ear of a comatose child. The caloric test is painful and is never performed on an awake child or one who has a ruptured tympanic membrane. Doll’s head maneuver, funduscopic examination for papilledema, and assessment of pyramidal tract lesions can be performed on awake children."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "A CT scan provides a visualization of the horizontal and vertical cross-sections of the brain at any axis. A nuclear brain scan uses a radioisotope that accumulates where the blood-brain barrier is defective. Echoencephalography identifies shifts in midline structures of the brain as a result of intracranial lesions. MRI permits visualization of morphologic features of target structures and permits tissue discrimination that is unavailable with any other techniques."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Respiratory effectiveness is the primary concern in the care of the unconscious child. Establishment of an adequate airway is always the first priority. A neurologic assessment and determination of whether a neck injury is present will be performed after breathing and circulation are stabilized. Intracranial, not intercranial, pressure is monitored if indicated after airway, breathing, and circulation are maintained."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Often comatose patients cannot cope with the quantity of fluids that they normally tolerate. Overhydration must be avoided to prevent fatal cerebral edema. The child’s position should be changed frequently to avoid complications such as pneumonia and skin breakdown. Narcotics and sedatives should be used as necessary to reduce pain and discomfort, which can increase ICP. Antipyretics are the method of choice for fever reduction."

        "Choice 1": "Petechial hemorrhages cause amnesia.",
        "Choice 2": "Visible bruising and tearing of cerebral tissue occur.",
        "Choice 3": "It is a transient and reversible neuronal dysfunction.",
        "Choice 4": "A slight lesion develops remotely from the site of trauma.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "A concussion is a transient, reversible neuronal dysfunction with instantaneous loss of awareness and responsiveness resulting from trauma to the head. Petechial hemorrhages along the superficial aspects of the brain along the point of impact are a type of contusion, but are not necessarily associated with amnesia. A contusion is visible bruising and tearing of cerebral tissue. Contrecoup is a lesion that develops remote from the site of trauma as a result of an acceleration-deceleration injury."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "A compound fracture has the bone exposed through the skin. A basilar fracture involves the basilar portion of the frontal, ethmoid, sphenoid, temporal, or occipital bone. Diastatic skull fractures are traumatic separations of the cranial sutures.  A depressed fracture has the bone pushed inward, causing pressure on the brain."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "A subdural hematoma is bleeding that occurs between the dura and the cerebrum as a result of a rupture of cortical veins that bridge the subdural space. An epidural hemorrhage occurs between the dura and the skull, is usually arterial with rapid brain concussion, and occurs most often in the parietotemporal region."

        "Choice 4": "confusion or abnormal behavior.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Medical attention should be sought if the child exhibits confusion or abnormal behavior, loses consciousness, has amnesia, has fluid leaking from the nose or ears, complains of blurred vision, or has an unsteady gait. Sleepiness alone does not require evaluation. If the child is difficult to arouse from sleep, medical attention should be obtained. Vomiting more than three times requires medical attention. Severe or worsening headache or one that interferes with sleep should be evaluated."

        "Choice 4": "check scalp and back for bleeding.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "After determining that the child is breathing and has adequate circulation, the next action is to stabilize the neck and spine to prevent any additional trauma. The child’s position should not be changed until the neck and spine are stabilized. Blood pressure is a later assessment. Less urgent, but an important assessment, is inspection of the scalp for bleeding."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Signs of brainstem injury include deep, rapid, periodic or intermittent, and gasping respirations. Wide fluctuations or noticeable slowing of the pulse, widening pulse pressure, or extreme fluctuations in blood pressure are consistent with a brainstem injury. Skull fracture, subdural hemorrhage, and epidural hemorrhage are not consistent with brainstem injuries."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Watery discharge from the nose that is positive for glucose suggests leaking of CSF from a skull fracture and is not associated with diabetes or respiratory tract infection. The fluid is probably CSF from a skull fracture and does not signify whether the brainstem is involved."

Her mother asks why a computed tomography (CT) scan is required when she “seems fine.” Which explanation should the nurse give?",
        "Choice 1": "Your child may have a brain injury and the CT can rule one out.",
        "Choice 2": "The CT needs to be done because of your child’s age.",
        "Choice 3": "Your child may start to have seizures and a baseline CT should be done.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The child’s history of the fall, brief loss of consciousness, and vomiting four times necessitates evaluation of a potential brain injury. The severity of a head injury may not be apparent on clinical examination but will be detectable on a CT scan. The need for the CT scan is related to the injury and symptoms, not the child’s age. The CT scan is necessary to determine whether a brain injury has occurred."

        "Choice 4": "Level of consciousness",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The most important nursing observation is assessment of the child’s level of consciousness. Alterations in consciousness appear earlier in the progression of an injury than do alterations of vital signs or focal neurologic signs. Neurologic posturing is indicative of neurologic damage. Vital signs and focal neurologic signs are later signs of progression when compared with level-of-consciousness changes."

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "A key nursing role is to provide sedation and analgesia for the child. Consultation with the appropriate practitioner is necessary to avoid conflict between the necessity to monitor the child’s neurologic status and the promotion of comfort and relief of anxiety. Information on the child’s previous experiences with pain should be obtained as part of the assessment, but because of the severity of injury, analgesia should be provided as soon as possible. Analgesia can be safely used in individuals who have sustained head injuries and can decrease anxiety and resultant increased ICP."

Although many children do not appear to have suffered adverse effects from the event, complications such as respiratory compromise and cerebral edema may occur 24 hours after the incident. The mother would not think the child is fine if oxygen were still required. The nurse should clarify that different complications can occur up to 24 hours later and that observations are necessary."

The nurse can demonstrate on a doll the expected size and shape of the dressing. Some of the symptoms may be alleviated by the removal of the tumor, but postsurgical headaches and cerebellar symptoms such as ataxia may be aggravated. Children should be prepared for the loss of their hair, and it should be removed in a sensitive, positive manner if the child is awake.

        "Choice 1": "“Epilepsy is easily treated.”",
        "Choice 2": "“Very few children have actual epilepsy.”",
        "Choice 3": "“The seizure may or may not mean that your child has epilepsy.”",
        "Choice 4": "“Your child has had only one convulsion; it probably won’t happen again.”",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Seizures are the indispensable characteristic of epilepsy; however, not every seizure is epileptic. Epilepsy is a chronic seizure disorder with recurrent and unprovoked seizures. The treatment of epilepsy involves a thorough assessment to determine the type of seizure the child is having and the cause, followed by individualized therapy to allow the child to have as normal a life as possible. The nurse should not make generalized comments regarding the incidence of epilepsy until further assessment is made."

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Clinical observations of generalized seizures indicate that the initial involvement is from both hemispheres. Focal seizures may arise from any area of the cerebral cortex, but the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes are most commonly affected. Partial seizures are caused by abnormal electric discharges from epileptogenic foci limited to a circumscribed region of the cerebral cortex. A seizure disorder that is acquired is a result of a brain injury from a variety of factors; it does not specify the type of seizure."

        "Explanation": "A predesigned protocol is used to wean a child gradually off antiseizure medications, usually when the child is seizure-free for 2 years and has a normal electroencephalogram (EEG). Medications must be gradually reduced to minimize the recurrence of seizures. Seizure medications can be safely discontinued. The risk of recurrence is greatest within the first year."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "If a large tumor was removed, the child is not placed on the operative side because the brain may suddenly shift to that cavity, causing trauma to the blood vessels, linings, and the brain itself. The child with an infratentorial procedure is usually positioned on either side with the bed flat. When a supratentorial craniotomy is performed, the head of bed is elevated 20 to 30 degrees with the child on either side or on the back. In a supratentorial craniotomy, the head elevation facilitates CSF drainage and decreases excessive blood flow to the brain to prevent hemorrhage. Pillows should be placed against the child’s back, not head, to maintain the desired position."

        "Answer": ", , , , , , , ",
        "Explanation": "The measurement of glycosylated hemoglobin (hemoglobin A1c) levels is a satisfactory method for assessing control of the diabetes. As red blood cells circulate in the bloodstream, glucose molecules gradually attach to the hemoglobin A molecules and remain there for the lifetime of the red blood cell, approximately 120 days. The attachment is not reversible; therefore, this glycosylated hemoglobin reflects the average blood glucose levels over the previous 2 to 3 months. The test is a satisfactory method for assessing control, detecting incorrect testing, monitoring the effectiveness of changes in treatment, defining patients’ goals, and detecting nonadherence. Hemoglobin A1c levels of less than 7% are a well-established goal at most care centers."

        "Explanation": "Family stress theory explains the reaction of families to stressful events. In addition, the theory helps suggest factors that promote adaptation to the stress. Stressors, both positive and negative, are cumulative and affect the family. Adaptation requires a change in family structure or interaction. Interactional theory is not a family theory. Interactions are the basis of general systems theory. Developmental systems theory is an outgrowth of Duvall’s theory.

        "Explanation": "Because women in their thirties are almost 2.5 times as likely as women in their twenties to have higher-order plural births, increased childbearing among older women and the expanded use of fertility drugs have been associated with an increase in the multiple-birth ratio.

        "Explanation": "Twins work out a relationship that is reasonably satisfactory to both. They develop a remarkable capacity for cooperative play and considerable loyalty and generosity toward each other. Parents should foster individual differences and allow the children to follow their natural inclinations. Individuation does occur. In twinship, one member of the pair is more dominant, outgoing, and assertive than the other. Early separation may produce unnecessary stresses for the children.

        "Choice 1": "“My marital relationship can have a positive or negative effect on the role transition.”",
        "Choice 2": "“If an infant has special care needs, the parents’ sense of confidence in their new role is strengthened.”",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "If parents are supportive of each other, they can serve as positive influences on establishing satisfying parental roles. When marital tensions alter caregiving routines and interfere with the enjoyment of the infant, then the marital relationship has a negative effect. Infants with special care needs can be a significant source of added stress. Older parents are usually more able to cope with the greater financial responsibilities, changes in sleeping habits, and reduced time for each other and other children. Parents who have previous experience with parenting appear more relaxed, have less conflict in disciplinary relationships, and are more aware of normal growth and development."

The parents exert little or no control over their children’s actions. Dictatorial or authoritarian parents attempt to control their children’s behavior and attitudes through unquestioned mandates. They establish rules and regulations or standards of conduct that they expect to be followed rigidly and unquestioningly. Democratic parents combine permissive and dictatorial styles. They direct their children’s behavior and attitudes by emphasizing the reasons for rules and negatively reinforcing deviations. They respect the child’s individual nature."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "For effective discipline, parents must be consistent and must follow through with agreed-on actions. Realistic goals should be set for this age group. Parents should structure the environment to prevent unnecessary difficulties. Requests for behavior change should be phrased in a positive manner to provide direction for the child. Withdrawal of love and approval is never appropriate or effective. Discipline strategies should be appropriate to the child’s age, temperament, and severity of the misbehavior. Following rules rigidly and unquestioningly is beyond the developmental capabilities of a 4-year-old."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Through the use of physical punishment, children learn what they should not do. When parents are not around, it is more likely that children will misbehave because they have not learned to behave well for their own sake, but rather out of fear of punishment. Spanking can cause severe physical and psychological injury and interfere with effective parent-child interaction. Children do become accustomed to spanking, requiring more severe corporal punishment each time. The use of corporal punishment may interfere with the child’s development of moral reasoning."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "It is important for the parents not to withhold information about the adoption from the child. It is an essential component of the child’s identity. There is no recommended best time to tell children. It is believed that children should be told young enough so they do not remember a time when they did not know. It should be done before the children enter school to keep third parties from telling the children before the parents have had the opportunity."

In addition to difficulties in school, they often have profound sadness, depression, fear, insecurity, frequent crying, loss of appetite, and sleep disorders.

        "Explanation": "Treatment consists of the application of pediculicide and manual removal of nit cases. An extra-fine tooth comb facilitates manual removal. Parents should be cautioned against cutting the child’s hair short; lice infest short hair as well as long. It increases the child’s distress and serves as a continual reminder to peers who are prone to tease children with a different appearance.

Tick bites should be avoided by entering tick-infested areas with caution. Light-colored clothing should be worn to identify ticks easily. Long-sleeved shirts and long pants tucked into socks should be the attire. Early treatment of the erythema migrans (stage 1) can prevent the development of Lyme disease.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Rapid rewarming is accomplished by immersing the part in well-agitated water at 37.8° to 42.2° C (100° to 108° F). The frostbitten area should be rewarmed as soon as possible to avoid further tissue damage. Rapid rewarming results in less tissue necrosis than slow thawing."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "A third-degree, or full-thickness, burn is a serious injury that involves the entire epidermis and dermis and extends into the subcutaneous tissues. Erythema and pain are characteristic of a first-degree, or superficial, burn. Erythema with blister formation is characteristic of a second-degree, or partial-thickness, burn. A fourth-degree burn is a full-thickness burn that also involves underlying structures such as muscle, fascia, and bone."

        "Question": "Which explains physiologically the edema formation that occurs with burns?",
        "Choice 1": "Vasoconstriction",
        "Choice 2": "Decreased capillary permeability",
        "Choice 3": "Increased capillary permeability",
        "Choice 4": "Decreased hydrostatic pressure within capillaries",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "With a major burn, an increase in capillary permeability occurs, allowing plasma proteins, fluids, and electrolytes to be lost. Maximal edema in a small wound occurs about 8 to 12 hours after injury. In larger injuries, the maximal edema may not occur until 18 to 24 hours. Vasoconstriction, decreased capillary permeability, and decreased hydrostatic pressure within capillaries are not physiologic mechanisms for edema formation in burn patients."

        "Choice 4": "Remove her burned clothing and jewelry.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "In major burns, burned clothing should be removed to avoid further damage from smoldering fabric and hot beads of melted synthetic materials. Jewelry is also removed to eliminate the transfer of heat from the metal and constriction resulting from edema formation. The burns should be covered, not wrapped with a clean cloth. A blanket can be used initially to stop the burning process. Fluids should not be given by mouth to avoid aspiration and water intoxication. The child should be kept warm. Placing her in a tub of cool water will exacerbate heat loss."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "In minor burns, the best method of treatment is to cleanse the wound with a mild soap and tepid water. Ice is not recommended. Most practitioners favor covering the wound with an antimicrobial ointment (not cortisone) to reduce the risk of infection and to provide some form of pain relief. The dressing is not occlusive but consists of nonadherent fine-mesh gauze placed over the ointment and a light wrap of gauze dressing that avoids interference with movement. This helps keep the wound clean and protects it from trauma."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "In minor burns, the best method to stop the burning process is to hold the burned area under cool running water. Ice is not recommended. Removal of blisters is not generally accepted therapy unless the injury is from a chemical substance. Cooling is necessary to stop the burning process."

        "Choice 3": "The diet will diminish risks of stress-induced hyperglycemia.",
        "Choice 4": "The diet will avoid protein breakdown.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The diet must provide sufficient calories to meet the increased metabolic needs and enough protein to avoid protein breakdown. Healing, not growth is the primary consideration. Many children have poor appetites, and supplementation will be necessary. Hypoglycemia, not hyperglycemia, can occur from the stress of burn injury because the liver glycogen stores are rapidly depleted."

They respond well to participating in decisions and should be given as many choices as possible. The dressing change procedure is painful and stressful. Misinformation should not be given to the child. Analgesia and sedation can and should be used. Encouraging the child to master stress with controlled passivity is not a positive coping strategy."

Keeping the skin hydrated is a goal of treating atopic dermatitis. Applying an emollient immediately after a bath helps to trap moisture and prevent moisture loss. Cool wet compresses should be used for relief. Bubble baths and harsh soaps should be avoided, as is bathing excessively, since this leads to drying. Fabric softener should be avoided because of the irritant effects of some of its components."

Electrical cords and outlets represent a potential risk to small children, who may chew on accessible cords and insert objects into outlets. The Consumer Product Safety Commission recommends a reduction of water heater thermostats to a maximum of 48.9° C (120° F). The increased use of microwave ovens has resulted in burn injuries from the extremely hot internal temperatures generated in heated items.

        "Question": "A nurse is caring for a 5-year-old child with a major burn. The health care provider has written a prescription to notify the health care provider if urine output falls to or below 2 ml/kg/hr. The child weighs 55 lb. The nurse should notify the health care provider if the milliliters of urine output is at or below _ for an hour. (Record your answer in a whole number.)",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": ", , , , ",
        "Explanation": "The primary emphasis during the emergent phase is the treatment of burn shock and the management of pulmonary status. Monitoring vital signs, output, fluid infusion, and respiratory parameters are ongoing activities in the hours immediately after injury. IV infusion is begun immediately and is regulated to maintain a urinary output of at least 1 to 2 ml/kg in children weighing less than 30 kg (66 pounds). To calculate the child’s weight in kilograms, the weight in pounds is divided by 2.2. That number is then multiplied by 2 to get the amount expected for a 1-hour period. 55/2.2 = 25 kg. 25 kg  2 ml = 50 ml per hour."

        "Explanation": "The physiologic effects of immobilization, as a result of decreased muscle contraction, include venous stasis. This can lead to pulmonary emboli or thrombi. A decreased vasopressor mechanism results in orthostatic hypotension, syncope, hypotension, decreased cerebral blood flow, and tachycardia. An altered distribution of blood volume is found with decreased cardiac workload and exercise tolerance. Immobilization causes a decreased efficiency of orthostatic neurovascular reflexes with an inability to adapt readily to the upright position and with pooling of blood in the extremities in the upright position."

        "Explanation": "If a fracture does not produce a break in the skin, it is called a simple, or closed, fracture. A compound, or open, fracture is one with an open wound through which the bone protrudes. A complicated fracture is one in which the bone fragments damage other organs or tissues. A comminuted fracture occurs when small fragments of bone are broken from the fractured shaft and lie in the surrounding tissue. These are rare in children."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Detection of epiphyseal injuries is sometimes difficult, but fractures involving the epiphysis or epiphyseal plate present special problems in determining whether bone growth will be affected. Healing of epiphyseal injuries is usually prompt. The epiphysis is the weakest point of the long bones. This is a frequent site of damage during trauma."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The injured extremity should be kept elevated while resting and in a sling when upright. This will increase venous return. Swelling of the fingers may indicate neurovascular damage and should be reported immediately. Permanent damage can occur within 6 to 8 hours.

        "Explanation": "If hot spots are felt on the cast surface, they usually indicate infection beneath the area. This should be reported so that a window can be made in the cast to observe the site. The five Ps of ischemia from a vascular injury are pain, pallor, pulselessness, paresthesia, and paralysis. Paresthesia is an indication of vascular injury, not infection. Cold toes may be indicative of too tight a cast and need further evaluation. Increased respirations may be indicative of a respiratory tract infection or pulmonary emboli. This should be reported, and child should be evaluated."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "When the muscles are stretched, muscle spasm ceases and permits realignment of the bone ends. The continued maintenance of traction is important during this phase because releasing the traction allows the muscle’s normal contracting ability to again cause malpositioning of the bone ends. Continuous traction must be maintained to keep the bone ends in satisfactory realignment. Releasing at any time, either 1 hour before surgery, once every hour for skin care, or once every 8 hours would not keep the fracture in satisfactory alignment."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Honesty is essential to gain the child’s cooperation and trust. The diagnosis of cancer should not be disguised with falsehoods. The adolescent should be prepared for the surgery so he or she has time to reflect on the diagnosis and subsequent treatment. This allows questions to be answered. To accept the need for radical surgery, the child must be aware of the lack of alternatives for treatment. Amputation is necessary, but it will not guarantee a cure. Chemotherapy is an integral part of the therapy with surgery. The child should be informed of the need for chemotherapy and its side effects before surgery."

        "Explanation": "NSAIDs are the first drugs used in JIA. Naproxen, ibuprofen, and tolmetin are approved for use in children. Aspirin, once the drug of choice, has been replaced by the NSAIDs because they have fewer side effects and easier administration schedules. Corticosteroids are used for life-threatening complications, incapacitating arthritis, and uveitis. Methotrexate is a second-line therapy for JIA."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The management of JIA is primarily pharmacologic. The family should be instructed regarding administration of medications and the value of regular schedule of administration to maintain a satisfactory blood level in the body. They need to know that NSAIDs should not be given on an empty stomach and to be alert for signs of toxicity. Warm moist heat is best for relieving stiffness and pain. Acetaminophen does not have antiinflammatory effects. Range-of-motion exercises should not be done during periods of inflammation."

        "Choice 1": "Elevate the left stump on a pillow.",
        "Choice 2": "Place ice pack on the stump.",
        "Choice 3": "Encourage the child to use an overhead bed trapeze when repositioning.",
        "Choice 4": "Replace the ace wrap covering the stump with a gauze dressing.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Use of the overhead bed trapeze should be encouraged to begin to build up the arm muscles necessary for walking with crutches. Stump elevation may be used during the first 24 hours, but after this time, the extremity should not be left in this position because contractures in the proximal joint will develop and seriously hamper ambulation. Ice would not be an appropriate intervention and would decrease circulation to the stump. Stump shaping is done postoperatively with special elastic bandaging using a figure-eight bandage, which applies pressure in a cone-shaped fashion. This technique decreases stump edema, controls hemorrhage, and aids in developing desired contours so the child will bear weight on the posterior aspect of the skin flap rather than on the end of the stump. This wrap should not be replaced with a gauze dressing."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The treatment for OI is primarily supportive. Although patients and families are optimistic about new research advances, there is no cure. The use of bisphosphonate therapy with IV pamidronate to promote increased bone density and prevent fractures has become standard therapy for many children with OI; however, long bones are weakened by prolonged treatment. Infants and children with this disorder require careful handling to prevent fractures. They must be supported when they are being turned, positioned, moved, and held. Even changing a diaper may cause a fracture in severely affected infants. These children should never be held by the ankles when being diapered but should be gently lifted by the buttocks or supported with pillows. Follow-up appointments for treatment with bisphosphonate can be expected."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "2, 3, 5",
        "Explanation": "The initial signs and symptoms of rhabdomyosarcoma tumors are related to the site of the tumor and compression of adjacent organs. Some tumor locations, such as the orbit, manifest early in the course of the illness. Other tumors, such as those of the retroperitoneal area, only produce symptoms when they are relatively large and compress adjacent organs. Unfortunately, many of the signs and symptoms attributable to rhabdomyosarcoma are vague and frequently suggest a common childhood illness, such as “earache” or “runny nose.” An abdominal mass, sore throat and ear pain, and ecchymosis of conjunctiva are signs of a rhabdomyosarcoma tumor. Bone fractures would be seen in osteosarcoma and a headache is a sign of a brain tumor."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Pseudohypertrophic (Duchenne) muscular dystrophy is inherited as an X-linked recessive gene. Genetic counseling is recommended for parents, female siblings, maternal aunts, and their female offspring. No effective treatment exists at this time for childhood muscular dystrophy. Maintaining optimal function of all muscles for as long as possible is the primary goal. It has been found that children who remain as active as possible are able to avoid wheelchair confinement for a longer time. Assisting the family in finding a nursing facility to provide his care is inappropriate at the time of diagnosis. When the child becomes increasingly incapacitated, the family may consider home-based care, a skilled nursing facility, or respite care to provide the necessary care."

        "Question": "Therapeutic management of a child with tetanus includes the administration of:",
        "Choice 1": "nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to reduce inflammation.",
        "Choice 2": "muscle stimulants to counteract muscle weakness.",

        "Choice 4": "tetanus immunoglobulin therapy.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Tetanus immunoglobulin therapy, to neutralize toxins, is the most specific therapy for tetanus. Tetanus toxin acts at the myoneural junction to produce muscular stiffness and lowers the threshold for reflex excitability. NSAIDs are not routinely used. Sedatives or muscle relaxants are used to help reduce titanic spasm and prevent seizures. Respiratory status is carefully evaluated for any signs of distress because muscle relaxants, opioids, and sedatives that may be prescribed may cause respiratory depression. Bronchodilators would not be used unless specifically indicated."

        "Question": "The nurse is conducting reflex testing on infants at a well-child clinic. Which reflex finding should be reported as abnormal and considered as a possible sign of cerebral palsy?",
        "Choice 1": "Tonic neck reflex at 5 months of age",
        "Choice 2": "Absent Moro reflex at 8 months of age",
        "Choice 3": "Moro reflex at 3 months of age",
        "Choice 4": "Extensor reflex at 7 months of age",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Establishing a diagnosis of cerebral palsy (CP) may be confirmed with the persistence of primitive reflexes: (1) either the asymmetric tonic neck reflex or persistent Moro reflex (beyond 4 months of age) and (2) the crossed extensor reflex. The tonic neck reflex normally disappears between 4 and 6 months of age. The crossed extensor reflex, which normally disappears by 4 months, is elicited by applying a noxious stimulus to the sole of one foot with the knee extended. Normally, the contralateral foot responds with extensor, abduction, and then adduction movements. The possibility of CP is suggested if these reflexes occur after 4 months."

        "Question": "The nurse is caring for an infant with myelomeningocele scheduled for surgical closure in the morning. Which interventions should the nurse plan for the care of the myelomeningocele sac?",
        "Choice 1": "Open to air",
        "Choice 2": "Covered with a sterile moist nonadherent dressing",
        "Choice 3": "Reinforcement of the original dressing if drainage noted",
        "Choice 4": "A diaper secured over the dressing",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Before surgical closure, the myelomeningocele is prevented from drying by the application of a sterile, moist, nonadherent dressing over the defect. The moistening solution is usually sterile normal saline. Dressings are changed frequently (every 2 to 4 hours), and the sac is closely inspected for leaks, abrasions, irritation, and any signs of infection. The sac must be carefully cleansed if it becomes soiled or contaminated. The original dressing would not be reinforced but changed as needed. A diaper is not placed over the dressing because stool contamination can occur."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Treatment of GBS is primarily supportive. In the acute phase, patients are hospitalized because respiratory and pharyngeal involvement may require assisted ventilation, sometimes with a temporary tracheotomy. Treatment modalities include aggressive ventilatory support in the event of respiratory compromise, intravenous (IV) administration of immunoglobulin (IVIG), and sometimes steroids; plasmapheresis and immunosuppressive drugs may also be used. Intake and output, telemetry monitoring and obtaining laboratory studies may be part of the plan of care but are not the priority."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The nurse should clarify the administration of an aminoglycoside antibiotic. Antibiotic therapy is not part of the management of infant botulism because the botulinum toxin is an intracellular molecule, and antibiotics would not be effective; aminoglycosides in particular should not be administered because they may potentiate the blocking effects of the neurotoxin. Treatment consists of immediate administration of botulism immune globulin intravenously (BIG-IV) without delaying for laboratory diagnosis. Early administration of BIG-IV neutralizes the toxin and stops the progression of the disease. The human-derived botulism antitoxin (BIG-IV) has been evaluated and is now available nationwide for use only in infant botulism. Approximately 50% of affected infants require intubation and mechanical ventilation; therefore, respiratory support is crucial, as is nutritional support because these infants are unable to feed."

        "Choice 1": "Place the adolescent in a flat right side-lying position.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The adolescent is experiencing an autonomic dysreflexia episode. The paralytic nature of autonomic function is replaced by autonomic dysreflexia, especially when the lesions are above the mid-thoracic level. This autonomic phenomenon is caused by visceral distention or irritation, particularly of the bowel or bladder. Sensory impulses are triggered and travel to the cord lesion, where they are blocked, which causes activation of sympathetic reflex action with disturbed central inhibitory control. Excessive sympathetic activity is manifested by a flushing face, sweating forehead, pupillary constriction, marked hypertension, headache, and bradycardia. The precipitating stimulus may be merely a full bladder or rectum or other internal or external sensory input. It can be a catastrophic event unless the irritation is relieved. Placing a cool washcloth on the adolescent’s forehead, continuing to monitor blood pressure and vital signs, and notifying the healthcare provider would not reverse the sympathetic reflex situation."

Corticosteroids are administered to minimize the inflammation present with the injury. It is not necessary to minimize environmental stimuli for this type of injury. Discussing long-term care issues with the family is inappropriate. The family is focusing on the recovery of their child.

Typically, affected boys have a waddling gait and lordosis, fall frequently, and develop a characteristic manner of rising from a squatting or sitting position on the floor (Gower sign). Lordosis occurs as a result of weakened pelvic muscles, and the waddling gait is a result of weakness in the gluteus medius and maximus muscles.

In cultures that value individual resourcefulness, competition would be acceptable. Status is culturally determined and varies according to each culture. Some will ascribe higher status to age or socioeconomic status. Social roles also are influenced by the culture. Race and culture are two distinct attributes. The racial grouping describes transmissible traits, whereas the culture is determined by the pattern of assumptions, beliefs, and practices that unconsciously frames or guides the outlook and decisions of a group of people. Cultural development may be limited by geographic boundaries. It is not the boundaries that are culturally determined."

The head end of the organism develops first and is large and complex, whereas the lower end is smaller and simpler, and development takes place at a later time. Proximodistal, or near to far, is another pattern of development. Limb buds develop before fingers and toes. Postnatally, the child has control of the shoulder before achieving mastery of the hands.

        "Explanation": "At the time of the beginning of menstruation or the skeletal age of 13 years, most girls have grown to about 95% of their adult height. They may have some additional growth (5%) until the epiphyseal plates are closed. Although growth cannot be definitively predicted, on average, 95% of adult height has been reached with the onset of menstruation.

        "Explanation": "The most accurate measure of skeletal age is radiologic examinations of the growth plates. These are the epiphyseal cartilage plates. Radiographs of the hand and wrist provide the most useful screening to determine skeletal age. Age of tooth eruption has considerable variation in children. It would not be a good determinant of skeletal age. Assessment of height over time will provide a record of the child’s height but not skeletal age.

When the infant searches for the toy under the blanket, it is an indication that object permanence has developed. Returning the blocks to the same spot on the table is not an example of object permanence. Recognizing that a ball of clay is the same when flattened out is an example of conservation, which occurs during the concrete operations stage from 7 to 11 years.

        "Question": "A father tells the nurse that his child is “filling up the house with collections” like seashells, bottle caps, baseball cards, and pennies. The nurse should recognize that the child is developing:",
        "Choice 1": "object permanence.",
        "Choice 2": "preoperational thinking.",
        "Choice 3": "concrete operational thinking.",
        "Choice 4": "ability to use abstract symbols.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "During concrete operations, children develop logical thought processes. They are able to classify, sort, order, and otherwise organize facts about the world. This ability fosters the child’s ability to create collections. Object permanence is the realization that items that leave the visual field still exist. This is a task of infancy and does not contribute to collections. Preoperational thinking is concrete and tangible. Children in this age group cannot reason beyond the observable, and they lack the ability to make deductions or generalizations. Collections are not typical for this developmental level. The ability to use abstract symbols is a characteristic of formal operations, which develops during adolescence. These children can develop and test hypotheses."

        "Question": "A visitor arrives at a daycare center during lunch time. The preschool children think that every time they have lunch a visitor will arrive. Which preoperational characteristic is being displayed?",
        "Choice 1": "Egocentrism",
        "Choice 2": "Transductive reasoning",
        "Choice 3": "Intuitive reasoning",
        "Choice 4": "Conservation",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Transductive reasoning is when two events occur together, they cause each other. The expectation that every time lunch is served a visitor will arrive is descriptive of transductive reasoning. Egocentrism is the inability to see things from any perspective than their own. Intuitive reasoning (e.g., the stars have to go to bed just as they do) is predominantly egocentric thought. Conservation (able to realize that physical factors such as volume, weight, and number remain the same even though outward appearances are changed) does not occur until school age."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "During the concrete operations stage of development, which occurs approximately between ages 7 and 11 years, increasingly logical and coherent thought processes occur. This is characterized by the child’s ability to classify, sort, order, and organize facts to use in problem solving. The progression from reflex activity to imitative behavior is characteristic of the sensorimotor stage of development. The inability to put oneself in another’s place is characteristic of the preoperational stage of development. The ability to think in abstract terms and draw logical conclusions is characteristic of the formal operations stage of development."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Preschoolers are most likely to exhibit characteristics of Kohlberg’s preconventional level of moral development. During this stage, they are culturally oriented to labels of good or bad, right or wrong. Children integrate these concepts based on the physical or pleasurable consequences of their actions. Obeying the rules of correct behavior, showing respect for authority, and engaging in behavior that pleases others are characteristics of Kohlberg’s conventional level of moral development."

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Conventional stage of moral development is described as obeying the rules, doing one’s duty, showing respect for authority, and maintaining the social order. This stage is characteristic of school-age children’s behavior. The preconventional stage is characteristic of the toddler and preschool age. At this stage, the child has no concept of the basic moral order that supports being good or bad. The post-conventional level is characteristic of an adolescent and occurs at the formal stage of operation. Undifferentiated describes an infant’s understanding of moral development."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The toddler playing with sand and water is engaging in sense-pleasure play. This is characterized by nonsocial situations in which the child is stimulated by objects in the environment. Infants engage in skill play when they persistently demonstrate and exercise newly acquired abilities. Dramatic play is the predominant form of play in the preschool period. Children pretend and fantasize. Social-affective play is one of the first types of play in which infants engage. The infant responds to interactions with people."

        "Explanation": "In associative play, no group goal is present. Each child acts according to his or her own wishes. Although the children may be involved in similar activities, no organization, division of labor, leadership assignment, or mutual goal exists. Solitary play describes children playing alone with toys different from those used by other children in the same area. Parallel play describes children playing independently but being among other children. Cooperative play is organized. Children play in a group with other children who play in activities for a common goal."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Playing with trucks next to each other but not together is an example of parallel play. Both children are engaged in similar activities in proximity to each other; however, they are each engaged in their own play. Sharing clay to make things is characteristic of associative play. Friends playing a board game together is characteristic of cooperative play. A child playing with something by herself on her mother’s lap is an example of solitary play."

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Teratogens are agents that cause birth defects when present in the prenatal period. Avoidance of alcoholic beverages is recommended to prevent fetal alcohol syndrome. Isotretinoin (Accutane) and phenytoin (Dilantin) have been shown to have teratogenic effects and should not be taken during pregnancy. Cytomegalovirus, an infection agent and a teratogen, can be transmitted through cat feces, and cleaning the litter box during pregnancy should be avoided."

        "Explanation": "The first parts of speech used are nouns, sometimes verbs (e.g., “go”), and combination words (e.g., “bye-bye”). Responses are usually structurally incomplete during the toddler period. The preschool child begins to use adjectives and adverbs to qualify nouns followed by adverbs to qualify nouns and verbs. Pronouns are not added until the later preschool years. By the time children enter school, they are able to use simple, structurally complete sentences that average five to seven words."

        "Explanation": "A common statement is that play is the work of childhood. Intellectual development is enhanced through the manipulation and exploration of objects. Socialization is encouraged by interpersonal activities and learning of social roles. In addition, creativity is developed through the experimentation characteristic of imaginative play. Physical development depends on many factors; play is not one of them. Temperament refers to behavioral tendencies that are observable from the time of birth.

Because children are easily distracted, perform each item quickly and present only one toy from the kit at a time. Before beginning the screening, ask whether the child was born preterm and correctly calculate the adjusted age. Up to 24 months of age, allowances are made for preterm infants by subtracting the number of weeks of missed gestation from their present age and testing them at the adjusted age.

        "Explanation": "Closed-ended questions should be avoided when attempting to elicit parents’ feelings. Open-ended questions require the parent to respond with more than a brief answer. Sympathy is having feelings or emotions in common with another person rather than understanding those feelings (empathy). Sympathy is not therapeutic in helping the relationship. Direct questions may obtain limited information. In addition, the parent may consider them threatening. Silence can be an effective interviewing tool.

Silence can be an effective interviewing tool. Silence permits the interviewee to sort out thoughts and feelings and search for responses to questions. To be effective, the nurse must be able to direct the focus of the interview while allowing maximal freedom of expression.

        "Question": "A nurse is preparing to assess a 3-year-old child. What communication technique should the nurse use for this child?",
        "Choice 1": "Focus communication on child.",
        "Choice 2": "Explain experiences of others to child.",
        "Choice 3": "Use easy analogies when possible.",
        "Choice 4": "Assure child that communication is private.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Because children of this age are able to see things only in terms of themselves, the best approach is to focus communication directly on them. Children should be provided with information about what they can do and how they will feel. With children who are egocentric, experiences of others, analogies, and assurances that the communication is private will not be effective because the child is not capable of understanding."

        "Question": "The nurse’s approach when introducing hospital equipment to a preschooler should be based on which principle?",
        "Choice 1": "The child may think the equipment is alive.",
        "Choice 2": "The child is too young to understand what the equipment does.",
        "Choice 3": "Explaining the equipment will only increase the child’s fear.",
        "Choice 4": "One brief explanation will be enough to reduce the child’s fear.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Young children attribute human characteristics to inanimate objects. They often fear that the objects may jump, bite, cut, or pinch all by themselves without human direction. Equipment should be kept out of sight until needed. The child should be given simple concrete explanations about what the equipment does and how it will feel to the child. Simple, concrete explanations will help alleviate the child’s fear. The preschooler will need repeated explanations as reassurance."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "School-age children have a heightened concern about body integrity. They place importance and value on their bodies and are oversensitive to anything that constitutes a threat or suggestion of injury. Body integrity is not as important a concern to toddlers, preschoolers, or adolescents."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "School-age children require explanations and reasons for everything. They are interested in the functional aspect of all procedures, objects, and activities. It is appropriate for the nurse to explain how equipment works and what will happen to the child. A nurse should respond positively for requests for information about procedures and health information. By not responding, the nurse may be limiting communication with the child. The child is not exhibiting anxiety, just requesting clarification of what will be occurring. The nurse must explain how the blood pressure cuff works so that the child can then observe during the procedure."

        "Choice 4": "Use the same type of language as the adolescent.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Adolescents, like all children, need an opportunity to express their feelings. Often they will interject feelings into their words. The nurse must be alert to the words and feelings expressed. Although the peer group is important to this age group, the focus of the interview should be on the adolescent. The nurse should clarify which information will be shared with other members of the health care team and any limits to confidentiality. The nurse should maintain a professional relationship with adolescents. To avoid misinterpretation of words and phrases that the adolescent may use, the nurse should clarify terms frequently."

        "Choice 1": "Suggest that the child keep a diary.",
        "Choice 2": "Suggest that the parent read fairy tales to the child.",
        "Choice 3": "Ask the parent if the child is always uncommunicative.",
        "Choice 4": "Ask the child to draw a picture.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Drawing is one of the most valuable forms of communication. Children’s drawings tell a great deal about them because they are projections of the child’s inner self. It would be difficult for a 6-year-old child who is most likely learning to read to keep a diary. Parents reading fairy tales to the child is a passive activity involving the parent and child. It would not facilitate communication with the nurse. The child is in a stressful situation and is probably uncomfortable with strangers."

        "Choice 1": "inappropriate, because of child’s age.",
        "Choice 2": "a way to establish rapport.",

        "Choice 4": "acceptable, if there is adequate time.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "A magic trick or other simple game may help alleviate anxiety for a 5-year-old. It is an excellent method to build rapport and facilitate cooperation during a procedure. Magic tricks appeal to the natural curiosity of young children. The nurse should establish rapport with the child. Failure to do so may cause the procedure to take longer and be more traumatic."

        "Choice 2": "Ask father to place the infant on the examination table.",
        "Choice 3": "Undress the infant while he is still sitting on his father’s lap.",
        "Choice 4": "Talk softly to the infant while taking him from his father.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Peek-a-boo is an excellent means of initiating communication with infants while maintaining a safe, nonthreatening distance. The child will most likely become upset if separated from his father. As much of the assessment as possible should be done on the father’s lap.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The chief complaint is the specific reason for the child’s visit to the clinic, office, or hospital. Because the adolescent is the focus of the history, this is an appropriate way to determine the chief complaint. A detailed listing of symptoms will make it difficult to determine the chief complaint. The adolescent should be prompted to tell which symptom caused him to seek help at this time. The chief complaint is usually written in the words that the parent or adolescent uses to describe the reason for seeking help. The parent and adolescent may be interviewed separately, but the nurse should determine the reason the adolescent is seeking attention at this time."

        "Explanation": "The history of the present illness is a narrative of the chief complaint from its earliest onset through its progression to the present. The focus of the present illness is on all factors relevant to the main problem, even if they have disappeared or changed during the onset, interval, and present. Past history refers to information that relates to previous aspects of the child’s health, not to the current problem. The chief complaint is the specific reason for the child’s visit to the clinic, office, or hospital. It does not contain the narrative portion describing the onset and progression. The review of systems is a specific review of each body system."

        "Explanation": "The past history refers to information that relates to previous aspects of the child’s health, not to the current problem. The mother’s difficult delivery and prematurity are important parts of the past history of an infant. The history of the present illness is a narrative of the chief complaint from its earliest onset through its progression to the present. Unless the chief complaint is directly related to the prematurity, this information is not included in the history of present illness. The chief complaint is the specific reason for the child’s visit to the clinic, office, or hospital. It would not include the birth information.

        "Choice 4": "Practitioner who administered the immunizations",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The occurrence of any reaction after an immunization was given is the most important to document in a history because of possible future reactions, especially allergic reactions. Exact dosage of the immunization received may not be recorded on the immunization record. Exact dates are important to obtain but not as important as a history of reaction to an immunization. The practitioner who administered the immunization does not need to be recorded in the health history. A potentially severe physiologic response is the most threatening and most important information to document for safety reasons."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Information about the attainment of developmental milestones is important to obtain. It provides data about the child’s growth and development that should be included in the past history. Developmental milestones provide important information about the child’s physical, social, and neurologic health and should be included in the history for a 3-year-old child.

        "Explanation": "Asking the adolescent girl whether she is having sex with anyone is a direct question that is well understood. The phrase sexually active is broadly defined and may not provide specific information to the nurse to provide necessary care. The word anyone is preferred to using gender-specific terms such as boyfriend or girlfriend. Because homosexual experimentation may occur, it is preferable to use gender-neutral terms.

        "Explanation": "Parents can remove clothing, and the child can remain on the parent’s lap. The nurse should use minimal physical contact initially to gain the child’s cooperation. The head-to-toe assessment can be done in older children but usually must be adapted in younger children. Traumatic procedures should always be performed last. These will most likely upset the child and inhibit cooperation. The nurse should introduce the equipment slowly. The child can inspect the equipment, but demonstrations are usually too complex for toddlers."

        "Explanation": "Murmurs are the sounds that are produced in the heart chambers or major arteries from the back-and-forth flow of blood. These are the sounds expected to be heard in a child with a ventricular septal defect because of the abnormal opening between the ventricles. S3 is a normal heart sound sometimes heard in children. S4 is rarely heard as a normal heart sound. If heard, medical evaluation is required. Physiologic splitting is the distinction of the two sounds in S2, which widens on inspiration.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The tailor position stretches the muscle responsible for the cremasteric reflex. This prevents its contraction, which pulls the testes into the pelvic cavity. Undescended testes cannot be predictably palpated. Inguinal hernias are not detected by this method. This position is used for inhibiting the cremasteric reflex.

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "A behavioral pain tool should be used when the child is preverbal or doesn’t have the language skills to express pain. The FLACC (face, legs, activity, cry, consolability) tool should be used with a 2-year-old child. The FACES, numeric, and Oucher scales are all self-report pain rating tools. Self-report measures are not sufficiently valid for children younger than 3 years of age because many are not able to accurately self-report their pain."

        "Choice 1": "Truthful reporting of pain should occur by this age.",
        "Choice 2": "Inconsistency in pain reporting suggests that pain is not present.",
        "Choice 3": "Children use pain experiences to manipulate their parents.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Children may deny pain to the nurse because they fear receiving an injectable analgesic or because they believe they deserve to suffer as a punishment for a misdeed. They may refuse to admit pain to a stranger but readily tell a parent. Truthfully reporting pain and inconsistency in pain reporting suggesting that pain is not present are common fallacies about children and pain. Pain is whatever the experiencing person says it is, whenever the person says it exists. Pain would not be questioned in an adult 12 hours after surgery."

        "Explanation": "Physiologic manifestations of pain may vary considerably, not providing a consistent measure of pain. Heart rate may increase or decrease. The same signs that may suggest fear, anxiety, or anger also indicate pain. In chronic pain, the body adapts, and these signs decrease or stabilize.

        "Explanation": "Nonpharmacologic techniques provide coping strategies that may help reduce pain perception, make the pain more tolerable, decrease anxiety, and enhance the effectiveness of analgesics. Nonpharmacologic techniques should be learned before the pain occurs. With severe pain, it is best to use both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic measures for pain control. The nonpharmacologic strategy should be matched with the child’s pain severity and taught to the child before the onset of the painful experience. Some of the techniques may facilitate the child’s experience with mild pain, but the child will still know the discomfort was present."

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "EMLA is an effective analgesic agent when applied to the skin 60 minutes before a procedure. It eliminates or reduces the pain from most procedures involving skin puncture. TAC provides skin anesthesia about 15 minutes after application to nonintact skin. The gel can be placed on the wound for suturing. Transdermal fentanyl patches are useful for continuous pain control, not rapid pain control. For maximal effectiveness, EMLA must be applied approximately 60 minutes in advance."

If the respiratory rate is depressed and the child cannot be aroused, then IV naloxone should be administered. The child will be in pain because of the reversal of the morphine. The morphine should be discontinued, but naloxone is indicated if the child is unresponsive. The child is unresponsive, therefore naloxone is indicated."

It has a larger content of mitochondrial cytochromes and a greater capacity for heat production through intensified metabolic activity than does ordinary adipose tissue. Heat generated in brown fat is distributed to other parts of the body by the blood. It is effective in heat production only. The newborn has a thin layer of subcutaneous fat, which does not provide for conservation of heat. Brown fat is located in superficial areas such as between the scapulae, around the neck, in the axillae, and behind the sternum.

        "Explanation": "Rectal temperatures are avoided in the newborn. If done incorrectly, the insertion of a thermometer into the rectum can perforate the mucosa. Rectal temperatures, if taken correctly, are considered an accurate reflection of core body temperature. The inherent risks and intrusive nature limit the use. The time it takes to determine body temperature is related to the equipment used, not the route only."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "A large, edematous, and pendulous scrotum in a term newborn, especially in those born in a breech position, is a normal finding. A hydrocele is fluid in the scrotum, usually unilateral, which usually resolves within a few months. The presence or absence of testes would be determined on palpation of the scrotum and inguinal canal. Absence of testes may be an indication of ambiguous genitalia. An inguinal hernia may be present at birth. It is more easily detected when the child is crying."

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Stroking the newborn’s cheek along the side of the mouth causes the newborn to turn the head toward that side and begin to suck is a description of the rooting reflex, which usually disappears by ages 3 to 4 months but may persist for up to 12 months. The Perez reflex involves stroking the newborn’s back when prone; the child flexes extremities, elevating head and pelvis. It disappears at ages 4 to 6 months. The newborn begins strong sucking movements in response to circumoral stimulation. The reflex persists throughout infancy, even without stimulation. Newborns force their tongues outward, when the tongue is touched or depressed. This reflex usually disappears by age 4 months."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "During the first period of reactivity, the newborn is alert, cries vigorously, may suck the fist greedily, and appears interested in the environment. The newborn’s eyes are usually wide open, suggesting that this is an excellent opportunity for mother, father, and child to see each other. The second period of reactivity begins when the newborn awakens from a deep sleep. The second period of reactivity ends when the amount of respiratory mucus has decreased. The mother should sleep and recover during the second stage, when the newborn is sleeping."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Attachment behaviors are thought to indicate the formation of emotional bonds between the newborn and the mother. The mother’s failure to make eye contact with her newborn may indicate difficulties with the formation of emotional bonds. The nurse should perform a more thorough assessment. Newborns do not have binocularity and cannot focus. It is uncommon for a mother to avoid making eye contact with her newborn and it is confrontational to ask why; this would put the mother in a defensive position."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Nasal flaring is an indication of respiratory distress. A nasal occlusion would prevent the child from breathing through the nose. Because newborns are obligatory nose breathers, this would require immediate referral. Sneezing and thin white mucus drainage are common in newborns and are not related to nasal flaring. Snuffles are indicated by a thick, bloody, nasal discharge without sneezing."

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Profuse drooling or salivation is a potential sign of a major abnormality. Newborns with esophageal atresia cannot swallow their oral secretions, resulting in excessive drooling. Nystagmus is an involuntary movement of the eyes. This is a common variation in newborns. Meconium, the first stool of newborns, is dark green or black. Pseudomenstruation may be present in normal newborns. This is a blood-tinged or mucoid vaginal discharge."

        "Explanation": "Maintaining a patent airway is the primary objective in the care of the newborn. The nurse uses a bulb syringe to clear the pharynx, followed by the nasal passages. Conserving the newborn’s body heat and maintaining a stable body temperature are important, but a patent airway must be established first. These are important functions, but physiologic stability is the first priority in the immediate care of the newborn."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Radiation is the loss of heat to a cooler solid object. The cold air from either the window or the air conditioner will cool the incubator walls and subsequently the newborn’s body. Conduction involves the loss of heat from the body because of direct contact of the skin with a cooler object. Convection is the loss of heat similar to conduction but aided by air currents. Evaporation is the loss of heat through moisture. The newborn should be quickly dried of the amniotic fluid."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Vitamin K is administered to prevent hemorrhagic disease of the newborn. Vitamin K is synthesized by the intestinal flora. Because the newborn’s intestine is sterile and breast milk is low in vitamin K, a supplemental source must be supplied. The purpose is not to enhance the immune response, prevent bacterial infection, or maintain nutritional status.

        "Explanation": "Nurses can positively influence the attachment of parent and child by recognizing and explaining individual differences to the parents. The nurse should emphasize the normalcy of these variations and demonstrate the uniqueness of each newborn. The nurse should facilitate parent-newborn interaction during the first period of reactivity. Decreasing the parents’ participation in care will interfere with parent-newborn attachment. The parents should be encouraged to hold the newborn when he or she is fussy and learn how best to soothe their newborn."

        "Explanation": "Supine is the position recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics to prevent sudden infant death syndrome. Sleeping in the prone position is not advised because of the possible link between sleeping in the prone position and sudden infant death syndrome. The child can be wrapped snugly, but should be placed on side or back. A bulb syringe should be kept by the bedside if necessary, but the pharynx should be suctioned before the nose."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The tonic neck reflex is elicited when the newborn’s head is turned to one side; the arm and leg extend on that side, and opposite arm and leg flex (fencing position). The Moro reflex is elicited by sudden jarring or change in equilibrium. The newborn has extension and abduction of extremities and fanning of fingers, with index finger and thumb forming a C shape followed by flexion and adduction of extremities; legs may weakly flex. The dancing reflex is elicited when the newborn is held so that the sole of the foot touches a hard surface; there is a reciprocal flexion and extension of the leg, simulating walking. The crawl reflex is elicited when the newborn is placed on the abdomen; the newborn makes crawling movements with arms and legs."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "3, 4, 5",
        "Explanation": "Parents preparing infant formula must wash their hands well and then wash all of the equipment used to prepare the formula (including the cans of formula) with soap and water. Sterilizing bottles and nipples 5 minutes in boiling water may be required when a hot-water dishwasher is not available. Similar to breastfed infants, bottle-fed infants need to be held on alternate sides of the lap to expose them to different stimuli. Bottled water should not be considered sterile unless otherwise indicated; bottled water without fluoride should be avoided for mixing infant formula. Propping the bottle during infant feedings at night time could cause the infant to aspirate. The feeding should not be hurried. Even though they may suck vigorously for the first 5 minutes and seem to be satisfied, infants should be allowed to continue sucking. Infants need at least 2 hours of sucking a day. If there are six feedings per day, then about 20 minutes of sucking at each feeding provide for oral gratification."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "A vaguely outlined area of edematous tissue situated over the portion of the scalp that presents in a vertex delivery is the definition of a caput succedaneum. The swelling consists of serum and/or blood accumulated in the tissues above the bone, and it may extend beyond the bone margin. Hydrocephalus is caused by an imbalance in production and absorption of cerebrospinal fluid. When production exceeds absorption, fluid accumulates within the ventricular system, causing dilation of the ventricles. A cephalhematoma has sharply demarcated boundaries that do not extend beyond the limits of the (bone) suture line. A subdural hematoma is located between the dura and the cerebrum. It would not be visible on the scalp."

        "Explanation": "A newborn with a broken clavicle may have no symptoms. The Moro reflex, which results in sudden extension and abduction of the extremities followed by flexion and adduction of the extremities, will most likely be asymmetric. The scarf sign that is used to determine gestational age should not be performed if a broken clavicle is suspected. Swelling of fingers on affected side and paralysis of affected extremity and muscles are not indicative of a fractured clavicle."

Candida albicans is the usual causative organism. Oral candidiasis is usually a benign disorder in the newborn, often confined to the oral and diaper regions. It is caused by a yeastlike organism and is treated with good hygiene, application of a fungicide, and correction of any underlying disorder.

        "Explanation": "Strawberry hemangiomas or capillary hemangiomas are benign cutaneous tumors that involve capillaries only. They are bright red, rubbery nodules with rough surfaces and well-defined margin. They may or may not be apparent at birth but enlarge during the first year of life and tend to resolve spontaneously by age 2 to 3 years. Port-wine stain is a vascular stain that is a permanent lesion and is present at birth. Initially it is a pink, red, or, rarely, purple stain of the skin that is flat at birth and thickens, darkens, and proportionately enlarges as the child grows. Melanoma is not differentiated into juvenile and adult forms. A cavernous hemangioma involves deeper vessels in the dermis and has a bluish red color and poorly defined margins."

        "Explanation": "Hypertonic fluids can damage cells if the fluid leaks from the vein. Careful monitoring is required to prevent severe tissue damage. Infiltrations occur for many reasons, not only activity. The vein, catheter, and fluid used all contribute to the possibility of infiltration. The continuous infusion pump may alarm when the pressure increases, but this does not alert the nurse to all infiltrations.

        "Choice 1": "Cleanse skin with a gentle alkaline-based soap and water.",
        "Choice 2": "Cleanse skin with a neutral pH solution only when necessary.",
        "Choice 3": "Thoroughly rinse skin with plain water after bathing in a mild hexachlorophene solution.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The premature newborn should be given baths no more than two or three times per week with a neutral pH solution. The eyes, oral and diaper areas, and pressure points should be cleansed daily. Alkaline-based soaps might destroy the acid mantle of the skin. They should not be used. The increased permeability of the skin facilitates absorption of the chemical ingredients. The newborn’s skin must be cleaned to remove stool and urine, which are irritating to the skin."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Warm water, mineral oil, or petrolatum can be used to facilitate the removal of adhesive. In the premature newborn, often it is impossible to avoid using adhesives and tape. The smallest amount of adhesive necessary should be used. Solvents should be avoided because they tend to dry and burn the delicate skin. Scissors should not be used to remove dressings or tape from the extremities of very small and immature newborns because it is easy to snip off tiny extremities or nick loosely attached skin."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Color pink but slightly mottled, arms and legs limp and extended, hiccups, respiratory pauses and gasping, and an irregular, rapid heart rate are signs of stress or fatigue in a newborn. Neonatal seizures usually have some type of repetitive movement from twitching to rhythmic jerking movements. The behavior of a preterm newborn may be inactive and listless. Respiratory distress is exhibited by retractions and nasal flaring."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Newborn stimulation is essential for growth and development. The appropriate time for the introduction of an individualized program is when developmental organization and stability are achieved at approximately 34 and 36 weeks of gestation. The newborn needs to be developmentally ready for a stimulation program. The newborn must be assessed to determine the readiness and appropriateness of the stimulation program. The program should be designed and implemented by the nursing staff. The family can be involved, as the nurses help teach the parents to be responsive to the child’s cues, but the stimulation should not depend on the family’s availability. An individualized stimulation program should be started when the child is developmentally ready."

        "Explanation": "Parents become apprehensive and excited as the time for discharge approaches. They have many concerns and insecurities regarding the care of their newborn. A major concern is that they may be unable to recognize signs of illness or distress in their newborn. Preparation for discharge should begin early and include helping the parent acquire the skills necessary for care. Apprehension and worry are normal adaptive responses. The NICU nurses should facilitate discharge by involving parents in care as soon as possible."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Naming the deceased newborn is an important step in the grieving process. It gives the parents a tangible person for whom to grieve, which is a key component of the grieving process. Tangible remembrances and photographs can make the newborn seem more real to the parents. Many NICUs will make bereavement memory packets, which may include a lock of hair, handprint, footprints, bedside name card, and other individualized objects. Families need to be informed of their options. The ritual of a funeral provides an opportunity for the parents to be supported by relatives and friends."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "When the parents are hesitant about holding and touching their newborn, the nurse should keep the newborn’s body for a few hours. Many parents change their minds after the initial shock of the newborn’s death. This will provide the parents time to see and hold their newborn if they desire. Stating that there is nothing to fear minimizes the parents’ feelings. The nurse should allow the family to parent their child as they wish in death, as in life. Many parents change their minds; if possible, the nurse should wrap the newborn in blankets and keep the newborn’s body on the unit for a few hours."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "A neutral thermal environment is one that permits the newborn to maintain a normal core temperature with minimal oxygen consumption and caloric expenditure. The Trendelenburg position should be avoided. This position can contribute to increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and reduced lung capacity from gravity pushing organs against diaphragm. Suctioning should be done only as necessary. Routine suctioning may cause bronchospasm, bradycardia due to vagal nerve stimulation, hypoxia, and increased ICP. Neck hyperextension is avoided because it reduces diameter of trachea."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "If a preterm newborn tires easily or has weak sucking when nipple feedings are initiated, the nurse should resume orogastric feedings with the milk of mother’s choice. When nipple feeding is unsuccessful, it is unlikely that the newborn will be able to breastfeed. Breast milk should be continued as long as the mother desires."

The excess bilirubin from the destroyed red blood cells cannot be excreted from the body. The fetal-maternal blood incompatibility and the associated red cell destruction by antibodies are the causes of hemolytic disease of the newborn.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Breastfeeding-associated jaundice is caused by decreased milk intake related to decreased caloric and fluid intake by the newborn before the mother’s milk is well established. Fasting is associated with decreased hepatic clearance of bilirubin; 0 to 24 hours is too soon. Jaundice within the first 24 hours is associated with hemolytic disease of the newborn; 4 to 5 days is too late. Jaundice at this time may be due to breast-milk jaundice."

        "Explanation": "Assessing for jaundice is part of the routine physical assessment in newborns. In dark-skinned newborns, the sclera, conjunctiva, and oral mucosa are the best place to observe jaundice because of the lack of skin pigmentation in these areas. The skin pigmentation in the buttocks, tip of nose and sclera, and palms of hands and soles of feet can mask the appearance of jaundice."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "When blood is drawn, phototherapy lights are turned off, and the blood is transported in a covered tube to avoid a false reading as a result of bilirubin destruction in the test tube. The lights will cause a degradation of the bilirubin in the sample, resulting in a falsely lowered result. The newborn does not need to be covered with a blanket. The phototherapy lights must be off.

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Hemolytic disease of the newborn results from an abnormally rapid rate of red blood cell (RBC) destruction. The major causes of this are Rh and maternal-fetal ABO incompatibility. If an Rh-negative mother has previously been exposed to Rh-positive blood through pregnancy or blood transfusion, antibodies to this blood group antigen may develop so that she is isoimmunized. With further exposure to Rh, the maternal antibodies will agglutinate with the red cells of the fetus who has the antigen and destroy the cells. Hemolytic disease is also caused by ABO incompatibilities. Blood type is the important consideration. If both parents are type O blood, ABO incompatibility would not be a possibility. The mother should have received Rho(D) immune globulin to prevent antibody development after the first pregnancy."

Laboratory analysis for calcium and blood glucose should be the priority intervention. Monitoring vital signs is important, but recognition of the possible hypocalcemia and hypoglycemia is imperative. A finding of glycosuria would not facilitate the diagnosis of hypoglycemia. A determination must be made between the hypocalcemia and hypoglycemia before treatment can be initiated."

        "Choice 1": "Allow newborn to sleep with pacifier to decrease stimuli.",
        "Choice 2": "Keep newborn awake to monitor central nervous system changes.",

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "For newborns with hypocalcemia, the nurse should manipulate the environment to reduce stimuli that might precipitate a seizure or tremors. A quiet, nonstimulating environment should be maintained for the newborn until calcium levels are normalized. Care should be provided without sudden jarring. Parents can be involved in observations and care when the child is awake."

        "Question": "Which is the central factor responsible for respiratory distress syndrome?",
        "Choice 1": "Deficient surfactant production",
        "Choice 2": "Overproduction of surfactant",
        "Choice 3": "Overdeveloped alveoli",
        "Choice 4": "Absence of alveoli",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The successful adaptation to extrauterine breathing requires numerous factors, which most term newborns successfully accomplish. Preterm newborns with respiratory distress are not able to adjust. The most likely central cause is the abnormal development of the surfactant system. The deficient production of surfactant results in unequal inflation of alveoli on inspiration and the collapse of the alveoli on end expiration. The number and state of development of the alveoli is not a central factor in respiratory distress syndrome. The instability of the alveoli related to the lack of surfactant is the causative issue."

        "Explanation": "Difficulty breathing, with grunting, tachypnea, and nasal flaring are clinical manifestations of respiratory distress syndrome and require further evaluation. This is not a normal finding and requires further evaluation. Cyanosis may be present, but these are significant findings indicative of respiratory distress without cyanosis. The child’s condition will most likely worsen for approximately 48 hours without intervention. Improvement may begin at 72 hours."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Positive pressure introduced by mechanical apparatus has created an increase in the incidence of ruptured alveoli and subsequent pneumothorax and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Meconium aspiration is not associated with mechanical ventilation. Tachypnea may be an indication of a pneumothorax, but it would not be transient. Retractions and nasal flaring are indications of the use of accessory muscles when the newborn cannot obtain sufficient oxygen. The use of mechanical ventilation bypasses the newborn’s need to use these muscles."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Suctioning is not an innocuous procedure and can cause bronchospasm, bradycardia, hypoxia, and increased ICP. It should never be carried out routinely. The Trendelenburg position should be avoided. This position can contribute to increased ICP and reduced lung capacity from gravity pushing organs against diaphragm.  Routine suctioning is avoided because of the potential complications of bronchospasm, bradycardia, hypoxia, and increased ICP."

        "Explanation": "The most common cause of anemia in preterm newborns is frequent blood-sample withdrawal and inadequate erythropoiesis in acutely ill newborns. Microsamples should be used for blood tests, and the amount of blood drawn should be monitored. Respiratory distress syndrome, meconium aspiration syndrome, and persistent pulmonary hypertension are not causes of anemia.

When this occurs in the germ cells, the translocation can be transmitted to the next generation. Trisomy is the condition in which three of a specific chromosome are found rather than the usual two. Monosomy is the condition in which one of a specific chromosome is noted rather than the usual two. The term is not used for males when the normal complement of sex chromosomes (one X and one Y) is present. Nondisjunction is the failure of a chromosome to separate during cell division.

The nurse and nutritionist should work with families to make the formula more palatable for the newborn. Phenylalanine hydroxylase is not effective because it cannot act within the cell where phenylalanine is metabolized.

        "Question": "A nurse is planning care for a premature newborn.  Which interventions should the nurse implement for skin care? (Select all that apply.)",
        "Choice 1": "Use cleaning agents with neutral pH.",
        "Choice 2": "Rub skin during drying.",
        "Choice 3": "Use adhesive remover solvent when removing tape.",
        "Choice 4": "Avoid removing adhesives for at least 24 hours.",
        "Choice 5": "Consider pectin barriers beneath adhesives.",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 4, 5",
        "Explanation": "The skin care for a premature newborn should include use of pH-neutral cleanser or soaps no more than two or three times a week. Adhesives should not be removed for at least 24 hours after application. Pectin barriers should be used beneath adhesives to protect skin. Avoid rubbing skin during bathing or drying. Do not use adhesive remover, solvents, or bonding agents. Adhesive removal can be facilitated using water, mineral oil, or petrolatum."

        "Question": "A nurse is assessing a premature newborn for the possibility of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).  Which assessment findings should the nurse expect to find if NEC is confirmed? (Select all that apply.)",
        "Choice 1": "Minimal gastric residual",
        "Choice 2": "Abdominal distention",
        "Choice 3": "Apnea",
        "Choice 4": "Urinary output at 2 ml/kg/hr",
        "Choice 5": "Unstable temperature",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "2, 3, 5",
        "Explanation": "The nurse should observe for indications of early development of NEC by checking the appearance of the abdomen for distention (measuring abdominal girth, measuring residual gastric contents before feedings, and listening for bowel sounds) and performing all routine assessments for high-risk neonates. The premature newborn may have apnea and unstable temperature if NEC is developing. The urinary output will be decreased and will be below the expected 2 ml/kg/hr."

        "Test Number": "3361",
        "Question": "A nurse is admitting a premature newborn to the NICU. Which interventions should the nurse implement to prevent retinopathy? (Select all that apply.)",
        "Choice 1": "Place on pulse oximetry.",
        "Choice 2": "Decrease exposure to bright, direct lighting.",
        "Choice 3": "Place on a cardiac monitor.",
        "Choice 4": "Cover eyes with an eye shield at night.",
        "Choice 5": "Use supplemental oxygen only when needed.",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 2, 5",
        "Explanation": "To prevent retinopathy, the nurse should provide preventive care by closely monitoring blood oxygen levels, responding promptly to saturation alarms, and preventing fluctuations in blood oxygen levels. Pulse oximetry is recommended to monitor the infant’s oxygenation status during resuscitation and to prevent excessive use of oxygen in both term and preterm infants. Decrease exposure to bright, direct lighting; although exposure to bright light has not been proven to contribute to retinopathy of prematurity, such exposure is undesirable from a neurobehavioral developmental perspective. Use supplemental oxygen judiciously and monitor oxygen blood levels carefully; prevent wide fluctuations in oxygen blood levels (hyperoxia and hypoxia). Placing the newborn on a cardiac monitor will not prevent retinopathy. Covering the eyes with eye shields is not a preventive measure for retinopathy."

        "Question": "A nurse is assessing a premature newborn. Which assessment findings are consistent with prematurity? (Select all that apply.)",
        "Choice 1": "Abundant lanugo over the body",
        "Choice 2": "Ear cartilage soft and pliable",
        "Choice 3": "Flexed body posture",
        "Choice 4": "Deep creases on the sole of the foot",
        "Choice 5": "Skin is bright pink, smooth, and shiny.",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 2, 5",
        "Explanation": "The premature newborn has fine lanugo hair that is abundant over the body. The ear cartilage is soft and pliable, and the soles and palms have minimal creases, resulting in a smooth appearance. The premature newborn’s skin is bright pink (often translucent, depending on the degree of immaturity), smooth, and shiny, with small blood vessels clearly visible underneath the thin epidermis. In contrast to full-term infants’ overall attitude of flexion and continuous activity, preterm infants may be inactive and listless. The extremities maintain an attitude of extension and remain in any position in which they are placed."

Therefore, the nurse should report the PCO2 of 49 and the HCO3- of  30."
