Which of the following would be the best recommendation for exercise for the nurse to make to the person?",
        "Choice 1": "Do not exercise because you have high blood pressure.",
        "Choice 2": "Use the stairs whenever you are entering or leaving the building.",
        "Choice 3": "Go for short walks around the block during the daytime only.",
        "Choice 4": "Purchase an exercise bike.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Exercise decreases blood pressure and thus should be encouraged in those with hypertension, especially aerobic activity. Participation in physical activity depends on the availability of facilities and a safe environment. Walking in the road is not safe, and it is also unlikely that this person, who lives in a subsidized housing project, has the funds to purchase an exercise bike. Therefore, using the stairs as much as possible would be a safe, inexpensive form of exercise for this person."

It is not appropriate to contact a support group without the person’s permission. The person may not be ready to discuss the issue with strangers. The correct response is part of grief work facilitation: helping another cope with painful feelings of actual or perceived responsibility."

        "Explanation": "Fatigue, nausea, and increased urinary frequency are all normal discomforts associated with pregnancy. These discomforts warrant anticipatory guidance from the nurse. A husband who resents the attention that his pregnant wife is receiving and the additional demands she may make on his time may lead him to abuse his wife. Therefore the nurse must obtain additional information and provide close follow-up when a woman states that her husband complains every time she asks him to do something because she may be at risk for abuse."

        "Question": "A woman who is 30 weeks pregnant tells the nurse that she and her husband are having sexual difficulties. Which of the following actions should the nurse take?",
        "Choice 1": "Tell the woman she should not be sexually active at this point in her pregnancy because it may harm the fetus.",
        "Choice 2": "Ask her to elaborate on the difficulties.",
        "Choice 3": "Tell her that they should modify their positions during intercourse and that will take care of the problem.",
        "Choice 4": "Tell her men like the way pregnant women look.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Some women worry about intercourse during pregnancy, fearing that it will cause miscarriage, infection, early delivery, or harm to the baby. Sexual dissatisfaction of the couple may result from restrictions in sexual positions, pain on penetration, increased vaginal discharge, breast tenderness, or the other physical discomforts of pregnancy such as fatigue or heartburn. The couple’s feeling about the woman’s changing body may alter their sexual relationship. The nurse’s first step in primary prevention intervention is to support the couple’s needs and relate, in a sensitive fashion, accurate information that facilitates couple’s intimacy during pregnancy. Asking her to elaborate on the difficulties allows the nurse to understand the root of the problem and develop an appropriate intervention. It also opens the lines of communication, so the nurse can discuss common difficulties experienced by couples and help her and her husband adjust to the challenges and discomforts of pregnancy. Giving the woman advice on position changes or body image may not be effective if it is not the cause of the difficulties."

Identifying godparents will help the woman find meaning in the changes and goals of pregnancy. Such religious beliefs assessments are components of the values-beliefs pattern."

        "Choice 1": "“You will know your HIV status in about 1 week when the results come back.”",
        "Choice 2": "“You will require additional testing for HIV as it is not tested for with the TORCH screen.”",

Sixty percent of maternal infections acquired during the third trimester result in fetal infection, which can lead to rash, enlarged lymph nodes and liver, inflammation of the heart, pneumonia, jaundice, and severe central nervous system damage after birth or years later.

        "Choice 1": "“Screening for group B Streptococcus is necessary as this infection can cause complications with pregnancy and to the unborn infant.”",
        "Choice 2": "“This screening will help us to determine if your unborn infant will be susceptible to respiratory distress when he or she is born.”",

        "Choice 1": "“Yes, you will need an injection of RhoGAM at 28 weeks gestation and within 72 hours after birth.”",
        "Choice 2": "“Because the father of the baby is also Rh negative, your baby will not inherit Rh positive blood cells and you will not need the injection.”",
        "Choice 3": "“Yes, you will need the injection because this is your first pregnancy. You will not need it with subsequent pregnancies.”",
        "Choice 4": "“No, you will not need the injection because you are White. Rh incompatibility affects only Black women.”",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Rh incompatibility sometimes affects fetal development. The problem usually occurs when the mother has Rh-negative blood cells and the fetus has Rh-positive blood cells, inherited from the father who also has Rh-positive blood cells. All women should be assessed for blood type, Rh factor, and antibody development at their first prenatal visits and again at 24 to 28 weeks, unless the father is Rh-negative. Rh incompatibility may be prevented by administering RhoGAM at 28 weeks and within 72 hours after birth. In this case, because the father is Rh negative, RhoGAM is not necessary."

        "Choice 1": "Tell the client that there is a high probability that her baby will have a birth defect",
        "Choice 2": "Tell the client not to worry because research indicates that in recommended doses Tylenol is safe.",

        "Explanation": "Research on aspirin and Tylenol indicates that both medications are safe in recommended doses. Little is known about the effects of herbal products and their interaction with other medications.

        "Explanation": "A breast-fed infant’s stools have an orange-yellow color and a soft, even consistency, with a slightly sour but clean smell, dissimilar to stools passed later in life. A bottle-fed infant’s stools are harder, smellier, and resemble those of an infant eating solid food. The breast-fed infant has many daily stools during the first and second months of life. The bottle-fed infant has two to four stools per day during the first month."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Parental stimulation of the infant is an important developmental technique. The infant needs stimulation to learn about the world. This activity does not require expensive objects, but rather involves experiences in sight, sound, and touch that are free and can be provided by any parent. One example of a stimulating experience for infants is being rocked in a rocking chair. Infant who are 3 months old will hold toys, but not actively reach for them so surrounding the infant with toys would not be suggested."

        "Question": "The mother of a 4-month-old infant is concerned about the possibility of SIDS because her neighbor’s daughter passed away last year as a result of SIDS. The mother reports she is so nervous that she has taken up smoking again. The mother informs you that the 4-month-old sleeps supine and takes a pacifier to help her fall asleep. Which of the following statements would be the best response from the nurse?",
        "Choice 1": "“You should place the infant in the bed with you until 6 months of age.”",
        "Choice 2": "“You should never give the infant a pacifier while she is sleeping.”",
        "Choice 3": "“You should try to stop smoking.”",
        "Choice 4": "“You should place the infant on her stomach.”",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The 2011 report from the American Academy of Pediatrics Task Force on SIDS recommended the following: healthy infants should be placed to sleep in the supine position; infants should be placed on a firm sleep surface keeping soft objects, loose bedding, or any objects that could increase the risk of entrapment, suffocation, or strangulation out of the crib; avoid the infant getting too hot by dressing him/her in too many clothes for the environment; keep the infant away from smokers and places where people smoke; sleep with the infant in the same room where you sleep, but not the same bed, for 6 months; and offer a pacifier at nap time and bedtime."

        "Choice 1": "Parents are encouraged to place their infants in the supine sleeping position.",
        "Choice 2": "SIDS is the leading cause of death among infants age 6 months to 1 year old.",
        "Choice 3": "SIDS is associated with infants who have had difficulty sleeping at night.",
        "Choice 4": "Parents are encouraged to limit the amount of “tummy time” of their infant.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Through the Back to Sleep program developed by the AAP, there has been a lower number of infant deaths from SIDS. This has encouraged the supine sleeping position. One of the consequences of the supine sleeping position is plagiocephaly. The primary intervention to decrease the risk of plagiocephaly is “tummy time.” Parents should be instructed to allow supervised tummy time while the infant is awake and cautioned about the amount of time their infant spends in a car seat. SIDS is the leading cause of death among infants 28 to 365 days of age. By definition, the cause of SIDS is not known."

        "Choice 4": "Has been adopted",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Because the parents’ self-esteem is associated closely with their infant’s interactions and accomplishments, when parents’ self-esteem is low, disappointment, anger, and a disturbance in the relationship with their infant can occur. When a disturbed parent-infant relationship continues, the infant is at risk for abuse and behavior problems. The process of paternal engrossment has been used to describe the behavior patterns of fathers when they interact with their infants."

        "Choice 4": "The infant grasps objects with two hands.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "One of the passive manifestations of abuse includes poor nutrition, failure to thrive, and severe malnutrition. Weight gain of 1 pound in 2 months indicates a problem with the infant’s growth and requires further data collection by the nurse. The other assessment findings are normal growth and development for a 4-month-old infant."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The most beneficial intervention the nurse can provide is to keep the visit short, weigh the infant, and offer the mother the help of community services. Providing anticipatory guidance is important in maintaining health and preventing abuse. Abusing parents are often socially isolated and have few people to whom to turn. Women are more frequent abusers than men. Furthermore, economic conditions play a role in the care of children."

        "Explanation": "Many injuries are difficult to differentiate from accidental injuries or culturally appropriate healing practices. Abusive parents are often hesitant to provide information, may be evasive, and may not exhibit feelings of guilt. However, these signs may also be present in nonabusive families. Therefore signs consistent with abusive parents should serve as a cue for further assessment. Additionally the nurse who is aware of cultural differences knows that coining, which can result in bruising, is a common cultural practice. Therefore in this case the nurse should ask the mother about the bruises."

        "Explanation": "Toddlers are at high risk for accidental injury because they lack judgment, and have limited physical coordination and a heightened level of curiosity. Toddlers love to explore and climb objects. Injuries to toddlers occur most often when they fall from furniture, stairs, or windows. Trying to reach the remote control on the top shelf of the entertainment center puts the child at immediate and greatest risk because of the potential for the entertainment center to fall on the child while he is trying to climb it."

        "Explanation": "Primary prevention for lead poisoning involves teaching parents about risk factors and the importance of a diet that encourages decreasing fat intake, because lead is retained in fat.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Toilet training is a major parental concern during toddlerhood. The nurse anticipates this and initiates discussion with the parent to determine their understanding of the child’s signs of development readiness. Before beginning toilet training, parents should check their toddler’s prerequisite skills. These include being able to walk, stop, and recover, stay dry for at least 2 hours during the day, and communicate sensation before elimination, as well as about the discomfort of wet or messy pants and the need for assistance. These prerequisites rarely develop before 18 months of age. Determining whether the child is ready will help to guide the discussion with the mother as well as help to determine the appropriate recommendations.

The nurse should provide anticipatory guidance to help the parents approach this curiosity and exploration, as well as masturbation as a normal developmental process.

The term “ethnicity” encompasses more than a cultural practice, which is what is being described by the person; it focuses on differences in meanings, values, and ways of living.

Maintaining harmony is an important value in Asian cultures, and it is strongly emphasized to avoid conflict and direct confrontation. As a result of this, Asian Americans may not show their disagreement with the recommendations of health care professionals.

Adapting nursing care to meet the needs of a person from an ethnic minority best meets this definition of transcultural nursing. A nurse may initially use previous knowledge about minority cultures to plan care, but then must individualize the care based on individual differences within the culture. Having an interpreter present will not be necessary when working with all persons from ethnic minorities. Attending a presentation about cultural diversity would assist the nurse in becoming more culturally competent, but it is not the best example of practicing transcultural nursing because no nursing care is being provided when attending a presentation."

Staff nurses who participated in this training program had higher cultural competence levels as compared with those who did not join this training program. Exploring complementary and alternative medicine practices used by other cultures will assist if a nurse is using these practices; however, depending on whom the nurse is caring for, this information may have limited usefulness. Discussing cultural differences with coworkers may help the nurse learn about other cultures, but it may not provide the best source of information.

        "Choice 1": "“Don’t worry; all teenagers do that.”",
        "Choice 2": "“Tell me about your daughter’s schedule.”",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Many teenagers take naps, although this does not address the mother’s concern. Although the nap can be a symptom of a health problem or drug use, additional information is necessary to make that determination. Asking the mother to tell you about her daughter’s schedule provides information to determine whether the behavior is normal or whether it requires further investigation."

        "Choice 1": "Arrested for petty theft",
        "Choice 2": "Decided he wants to major in accounting",
        "Choice 3": "Has recently broke up with his girlfriend",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The central task of adolescence according to Erikson is the establishment of identity, with the primary risk being role confusion. As the adolescent searches for direction, he makes choices in social, recreational, volunteer, academic, familial, and occupational activities. When the threat of confusion is exceedingly great, delinquent behavior and alterations in mental health can occur. Thus, a teenager arrested for petty theft is displaying delinquent behavior that may place him at risk for not meeting his developmental task of identity."

        "Choice 1": "Set strict rules to prevent the teenager from getting into any trouble.",
        "Choice 2": "Maintain an ongoing dialogue about important issues and upcoming challenges.",
        "Choice 3": "Maintain a friendship with the teenager, so he views parents as peers.",
        "Choice 4": "Be very lenient with the teenager so that he can figure out who he is as a person.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Imposing strict limits and eliminating all rules are not helpful to teenagers. Families in which parents maintain a willingness to listen, demonstrate an ongoing affection for and acceptance of their adolescent, yet still maintain some consistent limits, experience more constructive, positive outcomes during adolescence. Thus, maintaining an ongoing dialogue about important issues and upcoming challenges demonstrates the parents’ willingness to listen and their concern."

        "Choice 4": "Talks to her boyfriend on the phone for hours",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Adolescents often talk on the phone for hours, providing a safe way for them to interact with members of the opposite sex. However, adolescence is a time when teenagers fantasize about relationships and sex. Teenagers decide to become sexually active for a number of reasons, including affection. This can put them at increased risk for sexually transmitted diseases; therefore, anticipatory guidance regarding protection from sexually transmitted diseases needs to be provided before the adolescent is in a situation that can place him or her at risk."

Which of the following is the best initial response from the nurse?",
        "Choice 1": "“The changes during adolescence can be stressful as they struggle to come to terms with who they are. What other types of behaviors has she been displaying?”",
        "Choice 2": "“Changes in affect can be a warning sign for suicide. Has she had any increase in risk-taking behaviors or physical violence?”",
        "Choice 3": "“Is there any history of psychological disorders in your family?”",
        "Choice 4": "“Withdrawal can be a sign of substance abuse. Has she given you any indication she might be using illicit drugs?”",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Although dramatic swings in affect can be a warning sign for suicide, and withdrawal can be a sign of substance abuse, additional information is required before suggesting a diagnosis. Often, mood swings and spending more time with peers and less time with the family is normal adolescent behavior during this period of rapid change in physical, psychosocial, spiritual, moral, and cognitive growth. Parents and teenagers should be aware of and prepared for these changes."

        "Choice 2": "“The best way to protect yourself now is to make sure all your future sexual partners have received the vaccine.”",
        "Choice 3": "“You are correct, the vaccine is only indicated for females who have never been sexually active.”",
        "Choice 4": "“It depends on the number of partners you have had. If you have had less than five partners, you are still eligible for the vaccine.”",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The HPV vaccine is recommended for 11- to 12-year-old girls and for 13- to 26-year olds who have not yet received or completed the vaccine series. Ideally, females should receive the vaccine before they are sexually active because girls who have not been infected with any of the four HPV types covered by the vaccine will receive the full benefits of the vaccine. Females who are sexually active may also benefit but to a lesser degree. It is not known if the vaccine is effective in boys or men. Thus, the best response is, “You can still benefit from the vaccine, but there is a chance it will not be as effective.”"

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Anticipatory guidance during a physical exam is important. This includes asking about substance use. Questions should not be vague because they may be misinterpreted. Direct questions are useful when discussing sensitive topics. However, asking first about friends and the adolescent’s feelings about them is a good lead-in approach to a discussion about substance use."

        "Choice 1": "Talk to teenagers about sex, including abstinence, contraception, and sexually transmitted diseases.",
        "Choice 2": "Tell the teenagers they should abstain from sex until they are old enough to cope with the potential consequences such as an unwanted pregnancy.",
        "Choice 3": "Encourage parents of all teenage girls to make sure their daughters start oral contraceptives early.",
        "Choice 4": "Offer all teenagers free condoms when they come in for physical exams.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The emergence of secondary sexual characteristics increases adolescents’ awareness of themselves as sexual human beings leading to experimentation. Primary prevention is necessary to help prevent adolescent pregnancies. Parents, teachers, and health care providers will be more successful in assisting teens to manage their health needs if they treat them as joint partners. Talking to teenagers about sex, contraceptive options, and sexually transmitted diseases gives them the information and anticipatory guidance they need to help them make a decision."

        "Choice 4": "“A body piercing would be safer and less permanent.”",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Tattoos and piercings carry similar risks, which include localized infection, bleeding, and dermatitis. In addition, tattoos carry a heightened concern for blood-borne disease such as hepatitis and HIV. When providing anticipatory guidance, nurses should treat teenagers as partners and give them the information they need to make an informed decision. Therefore, informing the teenager about the risk of infection is the best response."

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The best day to perform a self-breast exam is 2 to 3 days after one’s period when breasts are least likely to be tender or swollen. A typical period lasts about 6 days. Thus, a teenager who starts her period on May 14 should perform a breast self-exam on May 23 (14 + 6 = 20 + 3 = 23)."

        "Explanation": "The onset of puberty usually begins around 11 to 13 years of age. Stage 2 is the usual time of peak height velocity for girls. Additionally, both sweat and sebaceous glands become more active during adolescence leading to sweat, body odor, and acne. Breast buds also usually appear during stage 2 of puberty. Females who have not begun pubertal development by age 14 should have an endocrine evaluation. Thus, the finding of lack of breast buds on this 14-year-old girl requires further investigation."

Research suggests that distractions, such as talking or texting on cell phones, eating, or playing with the radio, increase teen drivers’ risk of being involved in a crash.

In an ACO, physicians accept the responsibility for the quality of care provided and overall costs of delivering care to a defined population of patients. Accountable care organizations are composed of physicians, specialists, and hospitals, so a specialist will be able to be seen within the ACO.

        "Choice 4": "Preferred provider organization (PPO)",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "High deductible health insurance plans (HDHPs) are structured in a way similar to traditional managed care plans and fee-for-service plans but have a very high annual out-of-pocket deductible. Thus, a family with this type of insurance will pay out-of-pocket until they reach the deductible, which may make receiving health services expensive for them. Point-of-service plans allow members, for an additional fee and higher copayment, to use providers outside of the HMO network. Health maintenance organizations (HMOs) deliver comprehensive health maintenance and treatment services for a group of enrolled individuals who prepay a fixed fee. Preferred provider organizations (PPOs) have a preselected list of providers who have agreed to provide health services for those enrolled in the plan."

Medicare is available for those over the age of 65 and for people who require dialysis. Medicaid and SCHIP are available for children whose families meet the financial requirements.

The objective when assessing the sleep-rest pattern is to describe the effectiveness of the pattern from the person’s perspective. Wide variation in sleep time does not necessarily affect functional performance. Different individuals require different amounts of sleep.

A dysfunctional pattern is a problem when it represents a deviation from established norms or from the individual’s previous condition or goal.

A dysfunctional pattern is a problem when it represents a deviation from established norms or the individual’s previous condition or goal. Dysfunctional patterns may be present in the absence of disease, and nursing care may be necessary for health promotion and maintenance. The teenager, although free of disease, is in need of health promotion and disease prevention strategies because her sexual behavior indicates a dysfunction in her sexuality-reproductive pattern that places her at risk for a sexually transmitted disease and pregnancy."

        "Explanation": "Demographic data provides the basis for analysis and a means to identify groups that may be at high risk for health concerns. Age, gender, race, geographical location, consumption pattern, or lack of health services may be considered risk factors because one or more may contribute to disease or death and place the population sharing them at risk. Such information also provides clues for the direction of health strategies. It is known that poverty rates among African Americans are rising, placing them at risk for health disparities. Additionally, African Americans are at high risk of developing Type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. As a result, knowing that a majority of church members are African American has great implications for a community nurse when developing health promotion programs."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The goal of a screening program, identifying an individual as high risk or not, depends on the numerical value of the screening instrument. When the parameter for this distinction is not clear, a cutoff point is set. Above this point, the person is considered disease positive; below this point, the individual is considered disease negative. Thus, if the disease were potentially life-threatening or if a disease is relatively benign in terms of stigmatization, anxiety, and problems with treatment, the lower cutoff would be preferred. High cholesterol, if left untreated, could contribute to life-threatening cardiac disease. Additionally, it is benign in terms of stigmatization. Therefore, a lower cutoff point should be set."

        "Explanation": "Misinterpretation caused by screening instruments is of great ethical concern. A difficult ethical issue in screening is determining whether the benefits received by those who receive correct results are worth the problems experienced by those who receive incorrect results. In this case, the high specificity of the test would result in low false-positive rates and would correctly identify nondiseased individuals.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Providing health education during a screening falls under the Scope and Standards of Nursing Practice. Many chronic diseases are the result of health behaviors. The nurse’s role as educator is essential in the screening process because nurses provide individuals with the information necessary for choices that are made regarding healthy behavioral changes. Awareness is the first step in prevention. If awareness is combined with health education and health-promotion tools, people will have a better opportunity to manage their own risks. Thus, obtaining a person’s blood pressure while discussing the importance of exercise during a blood pressure screening is an example of a comprehensive health promotion activity."

Although she does not use birth control pills, there is no indication that she does not use other forms of birth control such as condoms that would also prevent against STDs. There is also no indication that she has had more than one sex partner and is at high risk for HIV infection. A cervical dysplasia screening is recommended for sexual active females.

        "Explanation": "Because cost containment in health care continues to be a national goal, it is important for community/public health nurses to continue to document the cost of nursing care and the savings that nursing care can provide (Deal, 1994). Home care expanded because nurses demonstrated that quality care can be provided for some clients in the home at a lower cost than in the hospital."

        "Explanation": "Beliefs of the nursing profession in general are to care for the sick and dying, promote the health of individuals and families, and provide holistic care to clients. One difference between community/public health nurses and other nurses is that they pay special attention to vulnerable and at-risk populations, especially elderly persons; infants; and disabled, ill, and poor persons."

        "Explanation": "The ethical principle of justice is defined as treating all people fairly. One way that community/public health nurses would exhibit justice is by providing nursing services to all, regardless of their ability to pay. Community/public health nurses can give care only within the limitations of third-party payer requirements. A difficulty for community/public health nurses is coping with the disparities in our current health care system."

        "Type": "Multiple",

        "Explanation": "Discussing the vision empowers nurses and helps them remember why they became nurses. It also allows other persons to become involved and to recognize new possibilities. Expressing the vision provides an opportunity for other persons to become partners in working for potential outcomes: not only the broader vision but also in relation to specific projects. Nurses do not force or coerce other persons, and they often work with members of other professions on issues related to health."

The young women themselves can be empowered by forming a group to share resources and pass them on to others when equipment (e.g., cribs) is no longer needed. However, in the long term, the community itself must recognize the problem and decide what actions might be appropriate. In a similar manner, in the long term, younger students need education on how to avoid the risks of early pregnancy."

        "Choice 1": "The client needed the appointment written down so the client could remember the exact time.",

        "Choice 2": "Using hand motions, pantomime, and touch to convey information",
        "Choice 3": "Requiring all staff nurses employed in the hospital to be bilingual",
        "Choice 4": "Using a computer to print index cards with essential phrases both in English and in the patient’s language",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "The CLAS standards suggest free language assistance, whereby bilingual staff and interpreter services are preferred. Although hand motions and pantomime may be used on a temporary basis, they are very prone to misinterpretation, and interpreters or a bilingual staff member must be sought immediately. The hospital cannot require any nurse to be bilingual, although such nurses should be actively recruited. Use of index cards is suggested in the text. In some geographic areas, so many ethnic groups use a particular hospital that having a computer program that could print the information needed in this instance would be a cost-effective way of being prepared."

        "Choice 1": "“Can you tell me about Italy? I’ve always wanted to go there.”",
        "Choice 2": "“I don’t know much about care in your country. Could you tell me what you expect from a nurse in a hospital?”",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Asking the client about her expectations will give the male nurse a chance to explain health care in the United States and how he may be able to help her. Also, if there are issues related to gender and having a care provider of a different gender, his opening will give her an opportunity to express any reservations."

        "Answer": "1",

Many Americans see time as linear, rapidly passing, and as something to be used efficiently, whereas other people see time as circular and never ending.

        "Explanation": "A nurse may choose a family perspective because family thinking gives a broader picture than an individual perspective, the family is a unit of care, the family assumes a crucial role in maintaining health, and dysfunction in one member may lead to added stress and depletion of resources for the entire family. Historically and traditionally, nurses have usually focused on the individual as a unit of care. Reimbursement depends on factors other than the nurse’s perspective as the nurse provides care."

        "Explanation": "The nurse can influence the family situation by being careful about personal communication. The nurse’s outside position allows for observation of family communication patterns that can be described to the family. The nurse can also demonstrate open, honest, direct communication, thereby role-modeling appropriate communication patterns. Emphasizing the importance of listening to professional suggestions, pointing out when communication is inappropriate, stating what family members should do, and telling the family how to best communicate are examples of a dominant role of the nurse with the family. The nurse’s role should be collaborative to encourage improvement in communication patterns."

        "Choice 1": "Assisting the family in finding a physician who can offer hope and possible treatment",
        "Choice 2": "Helping the family deal with anxiety and uncertainty",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Families who are dealing with illness and loss may encounter experiences in which nothing that they do will make the situation better. For example, a family may confront an irreversible loss, and no actions will rectify the situation. In these circumstances, both the nurse and the family often resolve the situation by searching for some meaning within what has happened."

        "Question": "The teenage mother admitted to the nurse that sometimes she was sorry she had the baby, and all she wanted was to be able to sleep all night. Which of the following is the most appropriate action for the nurse to take?",
        "Choice 1": "Ask the grandmother if she could take the baby for a few nights so the teenager could catch up on her sleep.",
        "Choice 2": "Assure the mother that her feelings were normal and that no one likes being exhausted.",
        "Choice 3": "Call Children’s Protective Services as this mother is at high risk for child abuse.",
        "Choice 4": "Explain normal growth and development for toddlers.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "It may help the mother to know that this situation is something all new mothers face and that her feelings are normal. Explaining normal growth and development for infants, not toddlers—including an expectation of when the baby might sleep through the night—would be most appropriate at this time. This would emphasize that the baby will eventually sleep through the night and the mother’s sleep will no longer be interrupted. In other words, there is hope. Suggesting that the grandmother provide assistance may be helpful, but it will not allow the teenager to recognize that these feelings are normal. Calling Child Protective Services is not appropriate."

        "Question": "A family had just moved to the city when the illness struck the father. The wife had always been a stay-at-home mother with the three young children. The nurse developed a list of short-term resources for the family. Which of the following actions should the nurse take next?",
        "Choice 1": "Give the family the complete list, including the free transportation assistance program.",
        "Choice 2": "Involve the family with a local church where people could educate the family about the community and be supportive.",
        "Choice 3": "Share with the family two resources that are the most immediate needs: namely, housing and food.",
        "Choice 4": "Tell the family about all the resources and let the family decide what to do with the list.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Many families have a need for multiple resources; identifying the one or two that are most helpful to the need will help both the nurse and the family. The entire list may well be overwhelming to the family when the family is already stressed and perhaps less able to make good decisions. Feeding the family and getting them settled will reduce their stress enough that they can then consider what would be most helpful."

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "The nurse should first mobilize social support from inside the family or from informal support networks such as friends, neighbors, and religious communities with which the family was already involved. These relationships are more likely to be long lasting and to be the most culturally appropriate."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "People have a tendency to want to stay the same, and so families usually resist change even if the change would be a helpful one. The nurse must help the family decide what they want to do."

The nurse assigned to the family decided to work on helping the family learn better coping mechanisms. The colleague asked why the nurse would try to create change when the family was under so much stress at the moment. Which of the following responses would be the most appropriate?",
        "Choice 1": "“At the moment, I don’t think the family will even notice I’m helping them change.”",
        "Choice 2": "“I’m only focusing on one person because if I can get one member to change, the others will change as well.”",

        "Choice 4": "“The family is under so much stress that one more stressor won’t matter.”",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Formulating a contract with the family at the beginning of the interaction, having a definite goal, and limiting the number of sessions help keep the interaction focused. It would not be therapeutic to suggest there are no other sources of help or that the problems are serious or have serious consequences (of which the family is probably already aware)."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Summative evaluation is performed after the care is complete and the nurse–family interaction is terminated. This is best demonstrated by quizzing a client about diabetic medications before discharge. Formative evaluation is performed as care is being given during the course of the family–nurse interaction to see whether instructions are understood and the plan is effective. Asking about understanding, eating habits, and reviewing blood glucose levels weekly are examples of formative evaluation."

        "Answer": "1, 2, 3, 4, 5",
        "Explanation": "A genogram is a map of family relationships for at least three generations that helps the family and nurse recognize important patterns and significant events in an objective way. The process is a way to safely begin to establish rapport. The genogram demonstrates relationships but also, in a calm and factual way, determines how the family members feel about other family members during the process."

        "Choice 1": "Such assessment helps the family recognize their own assets.",
        "Choice 2": "It creates a forum for change as family perspective changes.",
        "Choice 3": "It allows the family to avoid becoming depressed about the situation.",
        "Choice 4": "It helps the family see problem behaviors as assets to be used.",

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 2, 4, 5, 6",
        "Explanation": "Nurses use the strengths of the family to address the areas of need, but strengths must first be recognized or perceived by the family as assets. Even asking questions about strengths can be therapeutic and can help families recognize their own abilities. Problem behaviors may be reframed as areas of strength that might be very useful in a different context."

        "Choice 1": "External variables such as neighborhood environment",
        "Choice 2": "Family’s demands",
        "Choice 3": "Nurse’s competencies and preferences",
        "Choice 4": "Only needs related to health",

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "3, 5, 6",
        "Explanation": "Families may make unreasonable demands of someone who might be able to help them, and often no human could meet what they request. Furthermore, the needs of the family may be beyond the scope of the nurse’s competence or energy, and time and resources become a factor in making decisions about what a nurse can do. The agency and reimbursement mechanisms also dictate the nurse’s role. A successful community/public health nurse will be aware of personal strengths and preferences and try to use them whenever possible. Because health is related to all aspects of life, excluding variables not related to health would not really exclude many family desires. External variables in the neighborhood are typically beyond the nurse’s ability to repair."

        "Explanation": "Nurses help with growth and development issues, coping with losses and illness, adapting to the demands of or modifying the environment, strengthening inadequate resources and support, and dealing with disturbances in internal dynamics. The nurse as a teacher could help the teenage daughter understand normal growth and development of a very young child. As a counselor, the nurse could help the wife, who was having problems with the teenage daughter and the ill husband and seems to desperately need support. However, the husband’s stroke is a chronic condition now inasmuch as it happened 2 years ago, and it does not take priority. The teenage daughter’s not having daycare for her infant may cause additional stress for the family, but it would not be a priority for the nurse at this time."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 3",
        "Explanation": "While being an emotional support, bringing food, and volunteering to help with the funeral are all excellent community support tasks for a grieving family, the nurse’s responsibility is more to help the family be aware of resources, including helping them ask for and be willing to accept help during the crisis period. In crisis, the nurse can help the family identify its typical coping behaviors and support or encourage their use. Although the other offers (such as baby-sitting) might be helpful, the nurse must remain more a consultant than a direct caregiver."

        "Explanation": "Even though evaluation is the final step of the nursing process, it is also a step that starts at the beginning of the contact and occurs continually as the contact progresses. The word evaluate means to determine worth. Many methods can be used to evaluate nursing care, but the key to evaluation is to determine the correct criteria that demonstrate the value of the nursing contact. Criteria for evaluating client outcomes are derived from the objectives developed with the family. Only data relevant to the nurse’s intervention are collected. Because the outcomes of nursing interventions occurring during one visit may not be apparent until later, both long-term and short-term evaluative criteria should be developed. The family does not have to contribute data unless they choose to do so."

        "Answer": "1, 2, 5",
        "Explanation": "Careful planning, advance notice, and talking about the emotions and issues that arise are helpful for everyone involved. The nurse may often address the issue of termination before the client is ready to discuss it. Allowing clients to express reactions and helping families perceive themselves as being able to master upcoming situations independently will help the family make the transition to independence and termination. During the final visits, the nurse begins to prepare the family by reminding them that the time together is limited. A date or goal should be set that is understood as the marking point for termination. Criteria should be established for the family to know when to seek health care again."

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Multigenerational patterns are those that are passed down from one generation to another. The tendency to repeat these patterns is great, especially in view of the fact that the family members have known no other family experience. Doing what the individual knows how to do is easier than changing to something unfamiliar and unknown."

Which of the following reasons explains why the grandmother would say such a thing to her teenage daughter?",
        "Choice 1": "The teenager created the problem; therefore, she should be the one to cope with it.",
        "Choice 2": "The grandmother is jealous that the teenager is young and lacks responsibility.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Supporting other family members is a healthy internal coping strategy, whereas expressing hopelessness, refusing to change, or seeking others to rescue them are not adaptive or resilient behaviors. A resilient family proceeds through several stages after the presentation of a stressor: struggling to survive, adapting, accepting, growing stronger, and, sometimes, helping others. This allows the family to keep a sense of hopefulness."

        "Choice 1": "That health care providers blame the family for their problems",
        "Choice 2": "That health care providers expect the family to know about available resources",
        "Choice 3": "That health care providers plan for the short term and do not recognize long-term needs",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Health care professionals base their appraisal of family behavior on their own comfort zone of normality. Professionals also assume that families will act upon professionals’ expertise and accept their advice. Because multiproblem families may engage in illegal behaviors, such as abusing drugs, abusing children, or being absent from the family because of incarceration, some professionals may believe the family caused their own problems—and they let their feelings show. It must be remembered that health professionals are also people who are not perfect."

        "Type": "Single",

        "Explanation": "To build trust, the nurse should try again in a consistent manner. The best demonstration of this is leaving a note saying when the nurse will return and then returning when stated. This will help to build trust with the family. Multiproblem families often test professionals, and one responsibility of the nurse is to build trust through being reliable and consistent."

        "Explanation": "Many sources of demographic and epidemiologic data already collected, and often available on the Internet, may be used. It is not feasible or financially possible for the nurse to do a comprehensive community assessment in isolation. Performing a windshield survey does not allow the nurse to collect comprehensive health data about the community.

The nurse begins the process with the problem or topic area and then assesses a specific community in relation to that topic. If a particular problem has been identified in previously collected data, the nurse should assess the community in relation to the identified need before gathering resources, working with others, or trying to help colleagues, who may have other priorities."

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "The first step is to ensure that the need for change is recognized or felt by people in a position to help create the change. Disequilibria exist or are created, which disrupts the status quo. The stimulus for the perceived need may be within the client or come from an outside force."

        "Explanation": "The nurse must recognize that change is threatening and anxiety provoking, and so individuals will need help and support while they experience the proposed change. Asking other people to take a leadership role to speak out against the closure would not be appropriate. Writing to legislators may be effective, but it is not the best action when trying to work with people who are feeling vulnerable and insecure."

However, it is not realistic to ask this question of every member of the community. Thus, a random sample surveyed with a tool reliable and valid for an individual should yield an accurate portrayal of the proportion of members who experience positive self-esteem and satisfaction with their lives.

        "Explanation": "Evaluation reports need to be written for their audience, which may require more than one format. The nurse must be politically and culturally sensitive. Negative realities can be addressed with positive words. Remember that the most powerful and influential persons in the community may read the report. Consider the perspectives of the community members, and write in a way that does not reinforce cultural stereotypes or blame. Because the report may be long, writing an executive summary is helpful for people who do not have the time to read the whole report."

Only a very famous person’s problems would be a current media event that would create enough attention to cause a sudden great increase. External cues to action influence decisions related to health care behavior.

Information alone is insufficient to effect large-scale, community-wide behavioral change, as the widespread dissemination of information on the health risks of obesity clearly demonstrates. Environmental restructuring makes it more difficult to engage in the high-risk behavior and improves and optimizes the healthful conditions (air) existing in the environment."

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Screening is a major secondary level of prevention measure because secondary prevention is aimed at the early detection and treatment of illness.

        "Answer": "4",
        "Explanation": "Although the nurse should have prepared emergency plans for extremely dangerous client findings, and indeed the gentleman may need to be conveyed to a hospital, the first step should be to repeat the blood pressure measurement and confirm the reliability of the findings. Reliability refers to the consistency or reproducibility of test results over time and between examiners."

        "Type": "Single",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "When a problem is found, the nurse must inform the client and, in collaboration with the client, decide on referrals or how to follow up. After that, the nurse should indeed fill out the appropriate forms, give the client culturally appropriate literature if she seems interested in reading it, and prepare to screen the next client. However, the nurse should not let participants leave the screening until they have secured the number of a health care provider who is appropriate to deal with the identified problems."

        "Answer": "1, 2, 3, 4",
        "Explanation": "The primary deciding factor is what health risks are present in the target population. Additional variables to be considered include significant health problems in the community; support available from the community, including cultural issues and possible volunteers; and the use of screening tests that are safe, simple to administer, and cost-effective. Although publicity is often very helpful, photographs should not be a primary consideration.

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 5",
        "Explanation": "On a population level, choice of screening test is based on general sociodemographic factors rather than individual risk factors. Age, gender, and ethnicity factors affect the risk status of a population. Hence, population data are an important consideration in the planning of a health fair. The other population-based screenings can be offered in conjunction with national screening days."

        "Choice 2": "Measurements of height and weight",

        "Choice 6": "Vision and hearing",
        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 2",
        "Explanation": "On the basis of the age group that would be screened, the blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes screening would be most useful. Height and weight measurements are useful for assessing obesity, which is a risk factor for heart disease and stroke, two of the three leading causes of death in Americans. Tests such as mammography, prostate examinations, and stool for occult blood and sigmoidoscopy are more typically used in older populations. PPD, review of immunizations, and vision and hearing screenings are not necessary for a population of young adults."

        "Explanation": "Practical resources needed to support screening programs include funding, personnel, equipment, volunteers, follow-up diagnostic and treatment services, and support by key community leaders. Temporary employees would not typically be hired. With the low literacy rates, newspapers should not be the only public notification used. Rather, media should include flyers, mass mailings, and notices on community websites and local advertisements on radio and television, as well as in newspapers."

        "Choice 1": "“The agency requires such forms to document personnel time.”",
        "Choice 2": "“The information serves as data for duplicating the screening in the future.”",
        "Choice 3": "“You may wish to keep these data so that they are available for needed follow-up.”",
        "Choice 4": "“The form is needed for student education; the data are collated to determine community-wide needs.”",
        "Choice 5": "“Consent is needed before any tests, particularly invasive ones, are administered.”",

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "3, 5, 6",
        "Explanation": "Easy-to-use forms are typically used to document the data for counseling, instruction, and referral information. They provide test results for the participant and future providers, as well as for program evaluation. Consent is legally required before invasive screening measures such as blood measurements. It is hoped that students will use general sociodemographic variables such as age, gender, and ethnicity rather than a biased sample from one screening for determining community-wide needs. Agencies would assign personnel, so they would not need patients to fill out forms to confirm personnel activity."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 3",
        "Explanation": "Such media spots must be short (30 seconds or 75 words) and clarify how listeners will benefit. Fear (stressing the health risks) is not an effective long-term strategy. Visual aids would not be very effective with radio, which is an auditory medium. The screening is not for everyone, but for the college students (not staff or faculty).

        "Answer": "2, 3, 4",
        "Explanation": "The nurse must be sure the client meets eligibility requirements and is interested in the referral. The nurse must be aware of the payment mechanism that will be used for follow-up care so the client can be given names of community resources that are able to provide care on the basis of the source of payment. Contacting agencies about follow-up before the other actions with a client referral are completed is premature. Most agencies cannot provide free transportation and child care for clients to attend a different agency. It would encourage dependency for the nurse to make all the arrangements and then announce to clients what they should do. The client must be actively involved in follow-up care."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 4, 6",
        "Explanation": "When a nurse is teaching adults, a few of the strategies that should be included are encouraging the learner to share resources with the group during the program, teaching what the learner wants to know before continuing the instruction (otherwise the learner will not be able to focus on instruction if a question is not answered), and relating the content to life experiences. Because the learner’s needs should be addressed throughout the program, the focus should not be solely on delivering necessary content. An overview of the program is a good idea before the education is started; however, this does not need to be detailed. An ongoing support group may be appropriate for some participants depending on the nature of the presentation, but it is not necessary for some topics and groups."

        "Explanation": "An estimated 7.1 million low-income households spend more than 50% of their income on housing with no assistance from public assistance housing programs. Such households are one paycheck away from being homeless. Two adults, both employed full-time, may be able to rent a small apartment, but it is still difficult to save enough for the required deposit on a rental."

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Although letters to the editor might be helpful, it would be more effective for the nurse to write about community problems than for individual families to beg for help. Certainly sharing the location of community resources is central to the nurses’ role, including eligibility requirements and benefits available for food, clothing, housing, emotional support, etc."

        "Explanation": "By definition, a vulnerable population has mitigating factors that place them at greater risk for ongoing poor health status than other at-risk people or groups. A vulnerable population is more likely to develop health-related problems, have more difficulty accessing health care to address those health problems, and is more likely to experience a poor outcome or shorter life span from those health conditions. Awareness of problems is not a factor, since many diseases, such as hypertension, do not have observable symptoms and may not be diagnosed because the person may not have sought assistance."

        "Answer": "1, 2, 3, 4",
        "Explanation": "Statistical analysis of research demonstrates that vulnerable populations are overrepresented in juvenile justice and adult prison systems. Prisoners are more likely to come from single-parent homes and poverty, have lower levels of education, and have been exposed to drug trafficking, weapons, and gang violence. There is a disproportionate representation of racial minorities. Prisoners report more physical health problems, just more than 50% have a mental problem, and the risk of injury increases with time served."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "2, 4, 6",
        "Explanation": "Long-term effects of welfare reform on families include a drop in the number and percentage of needy families receiving help; lower average payment (the Earned Income Tax Credit) helps increase income; many children lost their health insurance; time limitations resulted in families losing benefits; educational pursuits are no longer considered a work activity; and the number of extremely poor is increasing.

        "Choice 1": "Consider every contact with clients an opportunity to ask about the health of their family members",
        "Choice 2": "Engage in extensive multiphasic testing to diagnose other possible medical problems",

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 3",
        "Explanation": "Although the nurse must complete the responsibilities of the nurse’s employing agency, the nurse can multitask through screening and interviewing each person or family concerning their health and the health of their family members while engaging in the required tasks. Voicing concern about funding to individual clients is not an effective way to change the health care system. Multiphasic testing would be wonderful but is not affordable in either time or other resources."

        "Choice 1": "Advocacy is an ethical and professional responsibility of all nurses.",
        "Choice 2": "Engaging in such actions will increase the nurse’s personal and professional visibility.",
        "Choice 3": "Speaking before such groups may well result in a promotion and an increased pay scale for the nurse when the nurse’s expertise is publicly recognized.",
        "Choice 4": "Such public speaking is part of the nurse’s role in most public health agencies.",

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 5",
        "Explanation": "Public speaking is not a requirement of the nurse’s role in most agencies. Nonetheless, the nurse may recognize that many people are truly not aware of the problems experienced by vulnerable groups. Speaking out helps increase public awareness. Furthermore, the ethical code for nurses states: “The nurse provides services with respect for human dignity and the uniqueness of the client, unrestricted by considerations of social or economic status, personal attributes, or the nature of health problems.” In other words, the nurse seeks to obtain care for clients and, if necessary, to seek funding for that care through political action."

        "Choice 1": "Bullying has a significant and long-lasting effect on children’s health.",
        "Choice 2": "Children can be taught how to effectively deal with bullies.",
        "Choice 3": "Most bullying occurs in elementary schools, especially on playgrounds during recess.",
        "Choice 4": "Screening for bullying is almost impossible because no one wants to be seen as a tattletale.",

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Schools are the site of ongoing violence, from excessive teasing to pushing, shoving, bullying, intimidation, stalking, physical assault, and even murder. Because bullying is often accepted as a part of growing up, as temporary, and as having little effect, the nurse must stress that bullying has health consequences across the life span."

The mother explained that the child apparently had gone quietly into the kitchen, climbed up on a chair, and was peeling an apple when he fell and the paring knife went into his tummy. She heard his screams and brought him to the emergency department. What will the advanced practice nurse want to be sure to do?",
        "Choice 1": "Ask the child what really happened.",
        "Choice 2": "Ask the mother why the child was still hungry after bedtime.",
        "Choice 3": "Examine the child carefully for evidence of past injuries.",
        "Choice 4": "Stitch the wound, order an antibiotic, and apply a small dressing.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Because abuse is rarely an isolated incident, evidence of past injuries may be present when a child is brought in for treatment. However, children rarely admit this in response to a direct question with the abuser in the room. Abused children typically protect their parents."

Firearms are the second leading cause of death among 10- to 19-year-olds. Regulations related to firearms are more lenient in the United States than in other developed countries, and so firearms are accessible. Higher rates of ownership are associated with higher homicide rates. Evaluation of legislation has not demonstrated that legislation reduces firearm violence."

        "Explanation": "Women have many reasons for staying, including hopes that the man will reform, there being no other place to go, having children (which makes it harder to find adequate financial resources or appropriate housing), and a belief that divorce is shameful. The woman may be emotionally dependent on the abusive spouse or may fear living alone. Finally, reprisals may indeed be worse, since women are at greater risk of being killed when they leave an abusive partner. Thus, the fear of not being safe when she moves to the shelter is valid."

        "Explanation": "The new mother will need social support and information, which may be successfully implemented through foster grandmother programs, mother support groups, and nursing visits every 3 months during early life. Books might be useful for some women; however, in view of the low literacy rate, there is a strong possibility that the books would not be read or understood. Although the nurse’s explaining appropriate behavior in the hospital might seem helpful, new mothers are under a high level of adjustment and stress, and this is not the best time for learning. Furthermore, new mothers are rarely in the hospital more than 2 days after a normal delivery. Screaming at an infant is an at-risk behavior and not an appropriate behavior for a new mother."

Teenagers in the United States are less likely to know contraceptive methods, to know how to obtain contraceptives, or to use contraceptives.

One study of California teenage mothers revealed that the fathers of their babies were an average of 3[PIC_20170114132026_0016.jpg] years older than the mothers.

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Studies have demonstrated that the baby’s father is generally available to the pregnant teenager before delivery, but their relationship weakens over time.

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The nurse should, in addition to the usual newborn assessment, look for signs of adequate maternal and infant bonding and evidence of attachment. Infants of young unwed mothers are at high risk for child abuse and neglect. It is important that the mother receive support from other people, but it is not appropriate for the grandmother to take over care, nor does the father need to be involved if other supports are in place.

Addiction is a disease of the brain, but that does not apply to the gateway theory of drug use. Adolescents may begin with occasional use and gradually increase use to a regular occurrence; however, this describes a different type of progression of drug use. Drug-seeking behavior is a primitive response that occurs before conscious awareness."

        "Explanation": "The first major legislative initiative that helped people with disabilities was the workers’ compensation laws; they provided financial support for workers unemployed because of work-related injuries. Disabilities laws provide protection from discrimination for people who are disabled. Community living legislation attempts to help disabled persons stay in the community and access support services as needed. Vocational rehabilitation acts authorized vocational rehabilitation services for those who are disabled."

        "Explanation": "The Balanced Budget Act narrowed the definition of “home-bound” so that people were no longer eligible for home care under Medicare if they were able to leave home for any reason other than medical services. The restriction was unfortunate because people should be encouraged to remain as active as possible within their physical limitations."

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Although the wife does need information and assistance, she will express feelings of being overwhelmed, both physically and emotionally, as she attempts to adjust to her new responsibilities.

Excessive sympathy, such as providing extra privileges, failing to hold the disabled person responsible, or attributing “good” qualities to someone because he or she is disabled, can be just as inhibiting.

The VetSuccess program helps veterans with disabilities acquired during their military service to “provide for, find, and keep suitable jobs.” Some veterans may be so disabled that they cannot work. Children are surviving congenital and traumatic illness or injury that results in disability. Disability rates increase with age.

It also required standards for compliance to overcome architectural, transportation, and communication barriers; entitled children to free, appropriate public education in the least restrictive setting; ensured that qualified people with disabilities may not be denied or discriminated against in education or employment; and required all new facilities built with federal funds be barrier free. Current sites do not have to become totally barrier free if the cost is unreasonable.

The client should be allowed to talk about his or her disability and not have to try to be an example of nobility by expressing only positive outcomes. Clients must be given an opportunity to acknowledge their loss and express grief.

The CHIP program (Title V) allows states to provide health insurance to children whose families are above the financial eligibility for Medicaid.

        "Question": "A 7-year-old boy happily introduced a nurse to a man he called “Dad” and a woman he called “Mom.” What may the nurse safely assume?",
        "Choice 1": "The mother and father are the child’s biologic parents.",
        "Choice 2": "The mother and the father are married to each other.",
        "Choice 3": "The child lives with a man and a woman whom he considers his parents.",
        "Choice 4": "The mother, father, and child live together as a nuclear family.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Although most children younger than 18 typically live with both parents, it is not safe to assume that either parent is the biologic parent or that they are married or that they live together. Thus, they may or may not be a nuclear family. On the basis of the introduction, the child considers the woman his mother and the man his father. Either one may be a stepparent or an adoptive parent. The values of affection and responsibility, not biology, are what bond contemporary families."

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Immunizations are required before a child enters school, and most parents decide whether to have a second child when the first child is at the preschool age. Parents and children learn to recognize communication cues when the child is still an infant.

After filling out the sports form and completing the examination, the nurse practitioner asked the mother to step out of the room.

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Although all of the options would be helpful, only a crisis number for when the mother believes she may be getting too frustrated and angry represents tertiary intervention. Families in abusive situations need parenting role models and a support system during periods of stress. Hotline or crisis telephone numbers can be one way to provide help in stressful situations. A support group and education are primary prevention. The child abuse would have been reported to children’s protective services the first time the child was hurt because such reporting is mandatory. It is hoped that a social welfare representative has been to the home and has concluded that the mother should keep the baby. Therefore, to maximize the health of the newborn, a hotline allows the mother to reach out for additional support."

        "Choice 1": "Hospitalized children are at risk for contracting a nosocomial infection and do not cope well with all the noise, light, and people.",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "The hospital setting interferes with normal growth and development and is a high-risk environment. A hospitalized child is at increased risk for contracting nosocomial infections because of invasive procedures, multiple caretakers, and increased contact with organisms from other children and staff.

        "Explanation": "Whether there are significant cost savings in home care of the ventilator-dependent child remains in question. When caregiver time value or forfeited wages are factored in, home care remains less costly in 70% of the situations. If the caregiver is not in the labor market or holds only a low-paying job, then it may be less expensive. The primary reason for home care is not to save money but the increased family interaction for the child."

        "Explanation": "Although any of these could be true, the most probable response, because a ventilator-dependent child requires more services than almost any other child, is that the overwhelmed mother feels inadequate and desperately needs a respite.

Clinic hours are limited, transportation can be unavailable, the fees may be high and unaffordable if they do not have health insurance, and the eligibility processes can be extremely challenging. Working with staff members from other cultures can also be a barrier; however, if the father knows many of the staff at the clinic, this would not be a barrier.

        "Explanation": "Parents decide on health care, with some exceptions such as refusal of lifesaving measures. In that case, the child has the right to petition the court. However, whenever possible, the nurse should give children opportunities to express opinions about decisions that affect them. Children should participate in the decision-making process as soon as they are able. Because children are minors, their parents or guardians make the legal decisions, such as consenting or not consenting to treatment. Although nurses can tell parents various options, the treatment is typically chosen by the parents in collaboration with the primary health care provider. It is not typically necessary to involve the ethics committee when procedures are performed. The committee is typically involved when the nurse is addressing an ethical dilemma. A physician has ordered the procedure, and so it should not be necessary to contact the primary physician before the procedure is performed."

        "Answer": "1, 2, 3, 6",
        "Explanation": "There are drawbacks to home care. Home environments become disrupted with high-technology equipment, which limits living space. Siblings feel displaced or frightened by all the equipment, procedures, and disrupted routines. Other siblings often have to serve as caregivers. Demands of caregiving, careers, household duties, and other children in the household limit leisure and cause stress. The most significant barrier is funding. Obtaining funding involves long waiting periods, negotiations, and evidence of discharge planning. Although insurance programs pay for inpatient care, they typically do not pay for home care."

What should the nurse discuss with the family before contacting the client’s physician?",

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Clients are often noncompliant with their medication regimens; levels of compliance range from not taking all the doses because of cost or confusion over the schedule to avoiding medications because of adverse drug reactions. Clients may also obtain medications from several physicians without any coordination. People have also been known to share drugs and take over-the-counter drugs without sharing that information with their care providers. Consequently, the medications being taken or given should be carefully determined. Pseudodementia, a mental disorder that is reversible when the underlying cause is treated, may be caused by the side effects of medications. Alzheimer disease generally has a slow, gradual onset, and so the potential medical diagnosis of Alzheimer disease is highly unlikely. It would not be a priority to discuss the client’s financial resources before the physician is contacted. The results of laboratory values from the client’s last blood test are not significant at this time as the client has experienced a change in condition since the test."

        "Choice 1": "Current RNs are aging.",
        "Choice 2": "Enrollment in nursing programs is not increasing.",

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 2",
        "Explanation": "The current shortfall may be protracted and difficult to remedy. Past shortages have been alleviated by an increase in salaries and increased enrollment. Today, enrollment in nursing programs is not expanding to meet the need. The current RN workforce is aging, with an average age of 46 years. These two factors (lack of expansion of enrollment and an aging workforce) may increase the length and severity of the current shortage period. While nurses are obtaining graduate degrees, many are continuing employment while going to school. Specialization does not remove a nurse from the workforce."

        "Explanation": "Competing interests hamper nurses’ struggles toward greater respect and autonomy. Nurse staffing has been undermined by the increased use of unlicensed assistive personnel. As nursing increases its voice and power, other professions must share in the decision-making process. Administrators have difficulty raising nurses’ wages because budgetary constraints do not always allow costs to be passed on to the consumer. Administrators have instead used signing bonuses and recruitment of new graduates. Direct reimbursement for advanced practice nurses has created conflict with physician groups. However, advanced practice nurses are able to obtain third-party reimbursement."

It requires insurance providers to expand coverage to young adults under age 26 to be covered under their parents’ health insurance plan. Medicaid eligibility will be expanded. State governments will need to have additional plans in place to cover more of their residents, but they will not be responsible for insuring all residents in the state.

Scabies and pediculosis are not reasons to have students stay home, because they are not dangerous. Tinea capitis and impetigo do not usually necessitate exclusion from school."

        "Explanation": "Medicaid is based on income and assets and is not contingent on any previous payments to the federal or state government.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Rural residents, many of whom are related to each other, typically accept help from family, friends, and other community members with the understanding that someday such help will be reciprocated. However, formal support from agencies cannot be accepted because of the cost and inability to “pay back” for such support."

        "Answer": "2",
        "Explanation": "Most people in a small town are recognized by the car that they drive, so seeing the car in the clinic parking lot can jeopardize confidentiality.

        "Explanation": "Both out-migration and in-migration can create problems that, in many instances, a small town cannot solve because of the lack of resources. Population shifts disrupt long-established informal “helping networks,” creating a need for unusual kinds of human services.

        "Explanation": "Rural residents, including elderly persons and children in the family, often work in dangerous occupations without immediately accessible health care. The poverty rate is high, since many are unemployed or retired. Agriculture is considered one of the four most dangerous occupations in America because its workers are exposed to lightning, farm machinery, firearms, drowning, and accidents involving vehicles such as snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles. In comparison with urban residents, rural residents suffer higher rates of chronic illnesses, mental illness, and stress-related diseases. Problems include machinery accidents, skin cancer from sun exposure, and breathing problems from exposure to chemicals and pesticides. Rural communities find it difficult to recruit or to retain qualified health care providers, and so the residents must travel long distances to obtain care. Being self-employed, few have health insurance or workers’ compensation insurance."

        "Explanation": "An out-of-community transfer by even one physician may cause a small hospital to close its doors because of insufficient staff. Large, expanding health care systems are “buying out” small hospitals and physician practices; then, to cut costs and improve profits, outreach services to rural communities are reduced or eliminated, forcing residents to travel to large city hospitals or do without health care."

        "Explanation": "Timothy, a 12-year-old boy, committed suicide after spending time in the foster care system in which he was placed so that he would be eligible for Medicaid services and unrestricted access to mental health services. Public outrage was so vast that the law named after him was created to ensure that such a loss did not recur. The law in New York requires that group health insurance provide at least 30 inpatient days and 20 outpatient visits per year for mental health treatment so that parents will not become so desperate as to give up their child to foster care in order to be eligible for Medicaid coverage for mental health care."

        "Explanation": "One of the best ways to help the community is by using primary prevention strategies; these strategies allow the nurse to intervene before a problem occurs. Although any such educational programs could be useful, the choice may depend in part on the local community’s needs and belief systems. The sexual education course may be an excellent approach, but in certain areas of the country, it would cause an uproar in the community. Physical education is also a high priority, but the leading causes of death in adolescents are accidents, homicide, and suicide. Therefore, preventing suicide would be the highest priority in the list."

Case management addresses the multifaceted and complex needs of the client and includes assessing the client’s needs, compiling a plan for services, and linking the client with needed services. Consulting allows the nurse to offer mental health services to agencies within the community. While providing therapy, the nurse is concerned with symptom management, relationship building, and ego strengthening. Teaching describes providing education to the client, family, and community."

        "Explanation": "The needs of severely mentally ill clients include basic life necessities, a sense that life is meaningful, access to medications, support for family members, and integration of nursing, medical, and social services. Many chronically mentally ill clients are without basic items. Access to medications is essential in order for the mental illness to be treated successfully. The burden of caregiving can be quite high, and so family support is crucial. Integration of services provided is necessary so that these clients can navigate the maze of services necessary to stay in the community. Not all these clients need a day treatment program, and some clients may not need additional services that require concern related to funding."

        "Explanation": "Nurses do have to charge for supplies used but can do so without understanding health care financing. In a position dealing with community/public health, advocating for a client may include making referrals to agencies that may be able to meet their needs on the basis of patient finances. All nurses have to focus on is giving care consistent with agency deadlines, which in turn must focus on reimbursement regulations in order to continue to be able to exist and provide care."

The nurse should not be expected to provide free care to other clients because of the legal risks involved.

        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Individuals and families may not obtain privately paid insurance because they live in a state where insurance companies are not required to offer it or, especially if they are members of a high-risk group, because they cannot afford it. For low-income and marginal middle-income individuals, the premium costs are simply unaffordable. Private insurance is usually purchased only by persons who have regular employment and an adequate income to do so. Services provided at free clinics cannot meet all of the client’s potential health care needs. It is highly recommended that all persons have health insurance because of the large expense associated with receiving care."

        "Explanation": "Low-income children who are not covered by other types of assistance programs may have health insurance coverage through CHIP, which took effect in 1997. Medicare is a federal program for elderly and disabled persons. A free clinic may meet short-term needs but will not help with long-term access to health care services.

        "Explanation": "Medicare has not changed substantially since it began, but benefits have been restricted as costs rise so that it does not meet the most serious medical needs of the population it serves.

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "2, 3, 5, 6",
        "Explanation": "Several major criticisms have been made of Medicare, primarily around institutional bias, service restrictions, and lack of equity. Medicare would not pay for less expensive outpatient procedures but only for inpatient hospital-based procedures until 2011. As cost sharing is an aspect of the program, the government has increased co-payments to reduce usage. Co-payments are a major hardship for a large percentage of elderly persons. Medicare pays less than half (45%) of health care costs. Justice is not served, inasmuch as both wealthy clients and poverty-stricken clients must pay the same amount for the same benefits, although in 2007 premiums for wealthy persons (income above $82,000/year) were increased. Lastly, the program was created to protect elderly persons from financial destitution. Those who have a major illness over a period of time cannot afford needed health services. Eventually they will exhaust their assets and then may be eligible for Medicaid."

It is important for the client to learn about disease progression; however, the nurse should be able to provide this education. It is important to determine how the disease is spread and, if necessary, encourage the client to avoid contact with others.

Because of overwhelming work issues, the community/public health nurse asked a licensed practical nurse (LPN) to care for the client for one day. When the LPN made an error that harmed the client, the client sued both the LPN and the community/public health nurse. Which of the following is the most likely outcome for this lawsuit?",
        "Choice 1": "As the supervisor responsible for delegating the care, the nurse is also responsible.",
        "Choice 2": "The nurse cannot be sued for an error made by someone else.",
        "Choice 3": "The nurse cannot be sued because the statute of limitations has been met.",
        "Choice 4": "Under respondeat superior, the nurse is responsible for everything any staff member does at any time.",
        "Type": "Single",
        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Because the community/public health nurse delegated care to an LPN for a seriously ill client whose condition was worsening, the community/public health nurse was responsible for the inappropriate delegation and therefore liable to suit for not using professional nursing judgment. As a supervisor, a nurse must not delegate tasks to workers that are beyond the scope of their knowledge base or the legal scope of their practice. If such workers harm a client while providing care, the community/public health nurse’s professional judgment when delegating such tasks will be assessed to determine whether it was reasonable. Respondeat superior occurs when nurses delegate tasks to other workers that are beyond the scope of their knowledge base, and it does not mean that the nurse is responsible for all of the other workers’ actions."

On what basis can the husband win his case?",
        "Choice 1": "The nurse should have avoided reassurance, because the client took the reassurance as a promise of the outcome.",
        "Choice 2": "The nurse should have given better care to help ensure that the wife survived her treatment.",
        "Choice 3": "The nurse should have read the wife’s medical record to determine her prognosis before reassuring her.",

        "Type": "Single",

        "Choice 3": "Only in civil cases does the guilty party go to jail; in criminal cases, financial penalties are imposed.",

        "Choice 1": "Because the nurse is required to follow such laws when providing nursing care",
        "Choice 2": "Because the nurse may be sued at any time for any reason",
        "Choice 3": "Because the nurse may be terminated by the agency if the law is not upheld",
        "Choice 4": "Because the nurse may have to quote the law to clients to explain nursing procedures",
        "Choice 5": "Because this law will protect the agency from lawsuits brought by unhappy clients",
