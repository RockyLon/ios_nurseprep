        "Explanation": "An increase in the mammary glands during pregnancy is a result of hormonal changes. The number of mammary cells increases in response to increased hormone levels.\r\nHyperplasia is correct, but it is not a compensatory response, but a hormonal response.\r\nHormonal is correct, but the growth is due to an increased number of cells, not enlargement.\r\nCompensatory is not correct, nor is anaplasia, a reversal to more immature cells.

Sodium and water can then enter the cell freely.\r\nKaryorrhexis means fragmentation of the nucleus into smaller particles or “nuclear dust.”\r\nRibosome detachment reduces protein synthesis.\r\nDehydration leads to loss of sodium and water."

        "Explanation": "Early dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum causes the ribosomes to detach from the rough endoplasmic reticulum, reducing protein synthesis.\r\nAerobic metabolism is a normal process and would not lead to swelling.\r\nCellular swelling will not alter cellular DNA.\r\nA reduction, not an increase, in the Na+-K+ pump leads to an intracellular accumulation of sodium and calcium and diffusion of potassium out of the cell. Sodium and water can then enter the cell freely, and cellular swelling results."

        "Answer": "1",
        "Explanation": "Reperfusion injury results from radicals that cause further membrane damage and mitochondrial calcium overload.\r\nVacuolation leads to cellular swelling and is not associated with reperfusion.\r\nLactic acid increases as a result of damage due to necrosis, and necrosis would interfere with reperfusion, not initiate it.\r\nLipid acceptor proteins bind with triglycerides to create fatty liver, and they do not affect the myocardium."

        "Answer": "3",
        "Explanation": "Symptoms of gram-negative septic shock are produced by endotoxins. Once in the blood, endotoxins cause the release of vasoactive peptides and cytokines that affect blood vessels, producing vasodilation, which reduces blood pressure, causes decreased oxygen delivery, and produces subsequent cardiovascular shock.\r\nGram-positive bacteria typically do not produce endotoxins and thus do not manifest in shock.\r\nFungi do not produce the endotoxic shock symptoms described.\r\nViruses do not produce symptoms of shock."

        "Explanation": "A craniopharyngioma originates from the pituitary gland or hypothalamus. Symptoms include headache, seizures, diabetes insipidus, early onset of puberty, and growth delay.\r\nAstrocytomas are located on the surface of the right or left cerebellar hemisphere and cause unilateral symptoms (occurring on the same side as the tumor), such as head tilt, limb ataxia, and nystagmus.\r\nEpendymoma develops in the fourth ventricle and arises from the ependymal cells that line the ventricular system. Because both tumors are located in the posterior fossa region along the midline, presenting signs and symptoms are similar and are usually related to hydrocephalus and increased intracranial pressure.\r\nMedulloblastoma occurs as an invasive malignant tumor that develops in the vermis of the cerebellum and may extend into the fourth ventricle."

When meningocele and myelomeningocele occur, they are related to an accompanying vertebral defect that allows the protrusion of the neural tube contents. Type II Chiari malformation is a complex malformation of the brain stem and cerebellum in which the cerebellar tonsils are displaced downward into the cervical spinal canal. This does not occur through a spina bifida. In acrania, the cranial vault is almost completely absent; an extensive defect of the vertebral column often is present. Craniosynostosis is the premature closure of one or more of the cranial sutures."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 2, 3, 4, 5",
        "Explanation": "Constipation can be caused by neurogenic disorders of the large intestine in which neural pathways or neurotransmitters are altered and colon transit time delayed. A low-residue diet (the habitual consumption of highly refined foods) decreases the volume and number of stools and causes constipation. A sedentary lifestyle and lack of regular exercise are other common causes of constipation. Lack of access to toilet facilities and consistent suppression of the urge to empty the bowel are other causes. Excessive use of antacids containing calcium carbonate or aluminum hydroxide often results in constipation. Opiates, particularly codeine, tend to inhibit bowel motility. Conditions associated with constipation include congenital megacolon, hypothyroidism, pelvic hiatal hernia, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord trauma, cancer, cerebrovascular disease, and irritable bowel syndrome-constipation predominant. Aging may result in changes in neuromuscular function, causing constipation."

        "Type": "Multiple",
        "Answer": "1, 2, 3",
        "Explanation": "Functional dysphasia is caused by neural or muscular disorders that interfere with voluntary swallowing or peristalsis. Disorders that affect the striated muscles of the upper esophagus interfere with the oropharyngeal (voluntary) phase of swallowing. Typical causes are dermatomyositis (a muscle disease) and neurologic impairments caused by cerebrovascular accidents, Parkinson disease, or achalasia.

        "Answer": "1, 3, 4, 5",
        "Explanation": "With obstruction lower in the intestine, metabolic acidosis is more likely to occur because bicarbonate from pancreatic secretions and bile cannot be reabsorbed. Hypokalemia can be extreme. Continued intestinal secretion and decreased absorption lead to decreased blood volume and elevates hematocrit, decreases central venous pressure, and causes tachycardia. Severe dehydration leads to hypovolemic shock. Bacteria also proliferate and may cross the mucosal barrier and cause peritonitis or sepsis."

        "Explanation": "The pattern of pain is different from that of duodenal ulcers as it frequently occurs immediately after eating. Gastric ulcers cause more anorexia, vomiting, and weight loss than duodenal ulcers. Gastric ulcers also tend to be chronic rather than alternating between periods of remission and exacerbation.
